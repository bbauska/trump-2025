  <meta name="description" content="'Zombie Politics and Culture in the Age of Casino Capitalism' 
    capitalizes upon the popularity of zombies, exploring the relevance of the metaphor they 
    provide for examining the political and pedagogical conditions that have produced a growing 
    culture of sadism, cruelty, disposability, and death in America. The zombie metaphor may seem 
    extreme, but it is particularly apt for drawing attention to the ways in which political 
    culture and power in American society now operate on a level of mere survival. This website 
    uses the metaphor not only to suggest the symbolic face of power: beginning and ending with 
    an analysis of authoritarianism, it attempts to mark and chart the visible registers of a kind 
    of zombie politics, including the emergence of right-wing teaching machines, a growing politics 
    of disposability, the emergence of a culture of cruelty, and the ongoing war being waged on 
    young people, especially on youth of color. By drawing attention to zombie politics and 
    authoritarianism, this website aims to break through the poisonous common sense that often 
    masks zombie politicians, anti-public intellectuals, politics, institutions, and social 
    relations, and bring into focus a new language, pedagogy, and politics in which the living 
    dead will be moved decisively to the margins rather than occupying the very center of politics 
    and everyday life. American international politics is half-court tennis. Rarely is the other
  side of the tennis court even considered in their policies.">

          <h2 class="chapter-title">The Rise of Zombie Politics, Democracy 
            and Threat of Authoritarianism (cadaver animatum)</h2>
          <p>According to the current press secretary, Feb, 2025 "Trump is playing four dimensional 
            chess, while you are all playing checkers." Quite a statement. I can hear the lip-lock 
            ass-smooching from 2300 miles away. And its deafening. Another question, why 
            are so many of Trump's cabinet nominees clearly unqualified for the position 
            assigned? We are making America great again. Isn't it a conflict of interest to 
            appoint someone whose corporate and stock profits would benefit from their being 
            placed in charge of regulatory agencies whose mission is to protect the consumer? 
            We are making America great again. What will happen to the CDC and the NIH if a 
            person with no scientific training and a clear political agenda is given the reins? 
            We will make America great again. Don't get me started on Musk.</p>

          <p>How does one resist these zombie politics and not give in to despair? How do we know 
            if we are slipping into fascism or if it has already slipped in through our back door 
            while we were just going on with our lives? It would certainly take a different form, 
            but could European history of the 1930's repeat itself here on American soil? Could I 
            ever demonstrate the kind of courage and resilience that my ancestors needed to survive 
            that history? How might I resist? See end of Website for answers.</p>

          <p>The zombie phenomenon on display nightly on television alongside endless examples of 
            destruction unfolding in real-time signals a shift away from the hope that accompanies 
            the living to a politics of cynicism and despair.<br>
            In the 2012 campaign cycle, One 'man' Adelson spent $100 million to support the 
            Republican cause. Koch brothers spent 257 million for their Republican causes.
            Bernie Sanders said “These oligarchs tell us we shouldn’t tax the rich,”. “The 
            oligarchs tell us we shouldn’t take on price gouging; we shouldn’t expand Medicare to 
            cover dental, hearing and vision; and we shouldn’t increase Social Security benefits 
            for struggling seniors.”<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>Then there is 'whataboutism'. How about solving one problem, then the other.
            Education is the point at which we decide whether we love the world enough to assume
            responsibility for it and by the same token save it from ruin which, except for renewal, 
            except for the coming of the new and young, would be inevitable. And education, too, is 
            where we decide whether we love our children enough not to expel them from our world and 
            leave them to their own devices, nor to strike from their hands their chance of 
            undertaking some­thing new, something unforeseen by us, but to prepare them in advance 
            for the task of renew­ing a common world.</p>

            <dd>
              <em>noun</em><br>
              <p>(in popular fiction) a person or reanimated corpse that has been turned 
                into a creature capable of movement but not of rational thought, which 
                feeds on human flesh.</p>
              <p>(informal)<br>
                a hypothetical being that responds to stimulus as a person would but that 
                does not experience consciousness.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>In the world of popular culture, zombies seem to be everywhere, as evidenced by
            the relentless slew of books, movies, video games, and comics. From the haunt­ing Night 
            of tbe Living Dead to the comic movie Zombieland, the figure of the zom­bie has captured 
            and touched something unique in the contemporary imagination.</p>

          <p>But the dark and terrifying image of the zombie with missing body parts, oozing
            body fluids, and an appetite for fresh, living, human brains does more than feed the
            mass-marketing machines that prey on the spectacle of the violent, grotesque, and
            ethically comatose. There is more at work in this wave of fascination with the
            grotesquely walking hyper-dead than a Hollywood appropriation of the dark
            recesses and unrestrained urges of the human mind. The zombie phenomenon is
            now on display nightly on television alongside endless examples of destruction
            unfolding in real-time. Such a cultural fascination with proliferating images of the
            living hyper-dead and unrelenting human catastrophes that extend from a global
            economic meltdown to the earthquake in Haiti to the ecological disaster caused by
            the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico signals a shift away from the hope that 
            accom­panies the living to a politics of cynicism and despair. The macabre double 
            move­ment between "the dead that walk"<sup>2</sup> and those who are alive but are dying and
            suffering cannot be understood outside of the casino capitalism that now shapes
            every aspect of society in its own image. A casino capitalist zombie politics views
            competition as a form of social combat, celebrates war as an extension of politics,
            and legitimates a ruthless Social Darwinism in which particular individuals and
            groups are considered simply redundant, disposable-nothing more than human
            waste left to stew in their own misfortune-easy prey for the zombies who have a
            ravenous appetite for chaos and revel in apocalyptic visions filled with destruction,
            decay, abandoned houses, burned-out cars, gutted landscapes, and trashed gas 
            sta­tions.</p>

          <p>The twenty-first-century zombies no longer emerge from the grave; they now
            inhabit the rich environs of Wall Street and roam the halls of the gilded monuments
            of greed such as Goldman Sachs. As an editorial in The New York Times points out,
            the new zombies of free-market fundamentalism turned "the financial system into 
            a casino. Like gambling, the transactions mostly just shifted paper money around
            the globe. Unlike gambling, they packed an enormous capacity for collective and
            economic destruction-hobbling banks that made bad bets, freezing credit and 
            eco­nomic activity. Society-not the bankers-bore the cost."<sup>3</sup> In this way the zombie­, 
            the immoral, sub-Nietzschean, id-driven "other" who is "hyper-dead" but still alive
            as an avatar of death and cruelty-provides an apt metaphor for a new kind of
            authoritarianism that has a grip on contemporary politics in the United States.<sup>4</sup> This
            is an authoritarianism in which mindless self-gratification becomes the sanctioned
            noun and public issues collapse into the realm of privatized anger and rage. The rule
            of the market offers the hyper-dead an opportunity to exercise unprecedented
            power in American society, reconstructing civic and political culture almost entire­ly 
            in the service of a politics that fuels the friend/enemy divide, even as 
            democra­cy becomes the scandal of casino capitalism-its ultimate humiliation.</p>

          <p>But the new zombies are not only wandering around in the banks, investment 
            houses, and death chambers of high finance, they have an ever-increasing presence 
            in the highest reaches of government and in the forefront of mainstream media. The 
            growing numbers of zombies in the mainstream media have huge financial back­ing 
            from the corporate elite and represent the new face of the culture of cruelty and 
            hatred in the second Gilded Age. Any mention of the social state, putting limits on 
            casino capitalism, and regulating corporate zombies puts Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, 
            Rush Limbaugh, and other talking heads into a state of high rage. They disparage 
            any discourse that embraces social justice, social responsibility, and human rights.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Appealing to "real" American values such as family, God, and Guns, they are in the 
            forefront of a zombie politics that opposes any legislation or policy designed to lessen 
            human suffering and promote economic and social progress. As Arun Gupta points 
            out, they are insistent in their opposition to "civil rights, school desegregation, 
            women's rights, labor organizing, the minimum wage, Social Security, LGBT 
            rights, welfare, immigrant rights, public education, reproductive rights, Medicare, 
            [and] Medicaid."<sup>5</sup> The walking hyper-dead even oppose providing the extension of 
            unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who are out of work, food, and 
            hope. They spectacularize hatred and trade in lies and misinformation. They make 
            populist appeals to the people while legitimating the power of the rich. They appeal 
            to common sense as a way of devaluing a culture of questioning and critical 
            exchange. Unrelenting in their role as archetypes of the hyper-dead, they are 
            mis­anthropes trading in fear, hatred, and hyper-nationalism.</p>

          <p>The human suffering produced by the walking hyper-dead can also be seen in 
            the nativist apoplexy resulting in the racist anti-immigration laws passed in Arizona, 
            the attempts to ban ethnic studies in public schools, the rise of the punishing state, 
            the social dumping of millions of people of color into prisons, and the attempts of 
            Tea Party fanatics and politicians who Want to "take back America" from President 
            Barack Obama-described in the new lexicon of right-wing political illiteracy as 
            both an alleged socialist and the new Hitler. Newt Gingrich joins Glenn Beck and 
            other members of the elite squad of the hyper-dead in arguing that Obama is just 
            another version of Joseph Stalin. For Gingrich and the rest of the zombie ideologues, 
            any discourse that advocates for social protections, easing human suffering, or 
            imagining a better future is dismissed by being compared to the horrors of the Nazi 
            holocaust. Dystopian discourse and End Times morbidity rule the collective 
            con­sciousness of this group.</p>

          <p>The "death panels" envisaged by Sarah Palin are not going to emerge from Obama's 
            health care reform plan but from the toolkits the zombie politicians and talking heads 
            open up every time they are given the opportunity to speak. The death threats, 
            vandalism, and crowds shouting homophobic slurs at openly gay U. S. House 
            Representative Barney Frank already speak to a fixation with images of death, violence, 
            and war that now grips the country. Sarah Palin's infamous call to a gath­ering of her 
            followers to "reload" in opposition to President Obama's policies-soon followed in a 
            nationally televised press conference with a request for the American people to embrace 
            Arizona's new xenophobic laws-makes her one of the most prominent of the political 
            zombies. Not only has she made less-than-vague endorse­ments of violence in many of her 
            public speeches, she has cheerfully embraced the new face of white supremacy in her 
            recent unapologetic endorsement of racial pro­filing, stating in a widely reported 
            speech that "It's time for Americans across this great country to stand up and say, 
            'We're all Arizonians now.'"<sup>6</sup> The current descent into racism, ignorance, 
            corruption, and mob idiocy makes clear the degree to which politics has become a sport 
            for zombies rather than engaged and thoughtful citi­zens.<sup>7</sup></p>
            
          <p>The hyper-dead celebrate talk radio haters such as Rush Limbaugh, whose 
            fanaticism appears to pass without criticism in the mainstream media. Limbaugh 
            echoes the fanatics who whipped up racial hatred in Weimar Germany, the ideo­logical 
            zombies who dissolved the line between reason and distortion-laden 
            propa­ganda. How else to explain his claim "that environmentalist terrorists might have 
            caused the ecological disaster in the gulf"?<sup>8</sup> The ethically frozen zombies that 
            dominate screen culture believe that only an appeal to self-interest motivates 
            peo­ple-a convenient counterpart to a culture of cruelty that rebukes, if not disdains, 
            any appeal to the virtues of a moral and just society. They smile at their audiences 
            while collapsing the distinction between opinions and reasoned arguments. They 
            report on Tea Party rallies while feeding the misplaced ideological frenzy that 
            motivates such gatherings but then refuse to comment on rallies all over the 
            coun­try that do not trade in violence or spectacle. They report uncritically on Islam 
            bash­ers, such as the radical right-wing radio host Michael Savage, as if his ultra-extremist 
            racist views are a legitimate part of the American mainstream. In the age of 
            zom­bie politics, there is too little public outrage or informed public anger over the 
            push­ing of millions of people out of their homes and jobs, the defunding of schools, and 
            the rising tide of homeless families and destitute communities. Instead of organized, 
            massive protests against casino capitalism, the American public is treated to an 
            end­less and arrogant display of wealth, greed, and power. Armies of zombies tune in 
            to gossip-laden entertainment, game, and realityTV shows, transfixed by the empty 
            lure of celebrity culture.</p>

          <p>The roaming hordes of celebrity zombie intellectuals work hard to fuel a sense
            of misguided fear and indignation toward democratic politics, the social state, and
            immigrants-all of which is spewed out in bitter words and comes terribly close to
            inciting violence. Zombies love death-dealing institutions, which accounts for why
            they rarely criticize the bloated military budget and the rise of the punishing state
            and its expanding prison system. They smile with patriotic glee, anxious to further
            the demands of empire as automated drones kill innocent civilians-conveniently
            dismissed as collateral damage-and the torture state rolls inexorably along in
            Afghanistan, Iraq, and in other hidden and unknown sites. The slaughter that
            inevitably follows catastrophe is not new, but the current politics of death has
            reached new heights and threatens to transform a weak democracy into a full­
            fledged authoritarian state.</p>

          <p>The American media, large segments of the public, and many educators widely believe 
             that authoritarianism is alien to the political landscape of American soci­ety. 
            Authoritarianism is generally associated with tyranny and governments that exercise 
            power in violation of the rule of law. A commonly held perception of the American 
            public is that authoritarianism is always elsewhere. It can be found in other allegedly 
            "less developed/civilized countries," such as contemporary China or Iran, or it belongs 
            to a fixed moment in modern history, often associated with the rise of twentieth-
            century totalitarianism in its different forms in Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union 
            under Stalin. Even as the United States became more disposed to modes of tyrannical 
            power under the second Bush administration-demon­strated, for example, by the existence 
            of secret CIA prisons, warrantless spying on Americans, and state-sanctioned kidnaping-
            mainstream liberals, intellectuals, journalists, and media pundits argued that any 
            suggestion that the United States was becoming an authoritarian society was simply 
            preposterous. For instance, the jour­nalist James Traub repeated the dominant view that 
            whatever problems the United States faced under the Bush administration had nothing to 
            do with a growing authoritarianism or its more extreme form, totalitarianism.<sup>9</sup> 
            On the contrary, according to this position, America simply beholden to a temporary 
            seizure of power by some extremists, who represented a form of political exceptionalism 
            and an annoying growth on the body politic. In other words, as repugnant as many of 
            Bush's domestic and foreign policies might have been, they neither threatened nor 
            compromised in any substantial way America's claim to being a democratic society.</p>

          <p>Against the notion that the Bush administration had pushed the United States 
            close to the brink of authoritarianism, some pundits have argued that this dark 
            moment in America's history, while uncharacteristic of a substantive democracy, had 
            to be understood as temporary perversion of American law and democratic ideals 
            that would end when George W. Bush concluded his second term in the White 
            House. In this view, the regime of George W. Bush and its demonstrated contempt 
            for democracy was explained away as the outgrowth of a random act of politics­ 
            a corrupt election and the bad-faith act of a conservative court in 2000 or a 
            poor­ly run election campaign in 2004 by an uncinematic and boring Democratic 
            candidate. According to this narrative, the Bush-Cheney regime exhibited such 
            extreme modes of governance in its embrace of an imperial presidency, its violation 
            of domestic and international laws, and its disdain for human rights and 
            democra­tic values that it was hard to view such anti-democratic policies as part of a 
            perva­sive shift toward a hidden order of authoritarian politics, which historically has 
            existed at the margins of American society It would be difficult to label such a 
            gov­ernment other than as shockingly and uniquely extremist, given a political legacy 
            that included the rise of the security and torture state; the creation of legal 
            illegal­ities in which civil liberties were trampled; the launching of an unjust war in 
            Iraq legitimated through official lies; the passing of legislative policies that 
            drained the federal surplus by giving away more than a trillion dollars in tax cuts to 
            the rich; the enactment of a shameful policy of preemptive war; the endorsement of an 
            inflated military budget at the expense of much-needed social programs; the selling off 
            of as many government institutions as possible to corporate interests; the resurrection 
            of an imperial presidency; an incessant attack against unions; support for a muzzled 
            and increasingly corporate-controlled media; the government production of fake 
            news reports to gain consent for regressive policies; the use of an Orwellian 
            vocab­ulary for disguising monstrous acts such as torture ("enhanced interrogation 
            tech­niques"); the furtherance of a racist campaign of legal harassment and incarceration 
            of Arabs, Muslims, and immigrants; the advancement of a prison binge through a 
            repressive policy of criminalization; the establishment of an unregulated and 
            ulti­mately devastating form of casino capitalism; the arrogant celebration and support 
            for the interests and values of big business at the expense of citizens and the com­mon 
            good; and the dismantling of social services and social safety nets as part of a larger 
            campaign of ushering in the corporate state and the reign of finance capital?

          <p>In the minds of the American public, the dominant media, and the accommodat­ing 
            pundits and intellectuals, there is no sense of how authoritarianism in its soft 
            and hard forms can manifest itself as anything other than horrible images of 
            con­centration camps, goose-stepping storm troopers, rigid modes of censorship, and 
            chilling spectacles of extremist government repression and violence. That is, there 
            is little understanding of how new modes of authoritarian ideology, policy, values, 
            and social relations might manifest themselves in degrees and gradations so as to 
            create the conditions for a distinctly undemocratic and increasingly cruel and 
            oppressive social order. As the late Susan Sontag suggested in another context, there 
            is a willful ignorance of how emerging registers of power and governance "dissolve 
            politics into pathology."<sup>10</sup> It is generally believed that in a constitutional
            democ­racy, power is in the hands of the people, and that the long legacy of democratic ideals in 
            America, however imperfect, is enough to prevent democracy from being subverted or lost. 
            And yet the lessons of history provide clear examples of how the emergence of 
            reactionary politics, the increasing power of the military; and the power of big 
            business subverted democracy in Argentina, Chile, Germany, and Italy. In spite of 
            these histories, there is no room in the public imagination to entertain what has 
            become the unthinkable-that such an order in its contemporary form might 
            be more nuanced, less theatrical, more cunning, less concerned with repressive modes 
            of control than with manipulative modes of consent-what one might call a mode of 
            authoritarianism with a distinctly American character.<sup>11</sup>
          </p>
          
          <p>Historical conjunctures produce different forms of authoritarianism, though 
            they all share a hatred for democracy, dissent, and civil liberties. It is too easy to 
            believe in a simplistic binary logic that strictly categorizes a country as either 
            authoritarian or democratic, which leaves no room for entertaining the possibility 
            of a mixture of both systems. American politics today suggests a more updated if 
            not a different form of authoritarianism. In this context, it is worth remembering 
            what Huey Long said in response to the question of whether America could ever 
            become fascist: "Yes, but we will call it anti-fascist."<sup>12</sup> Long's reply suggests that 
            fas­cism is not an ideological apparatus frozen in a particular historical period but a 
            complex and often shifting theoretical and political register for understanding how 
            democracy can be subverted, if not destroyed, from within. This notion of soft or 
            friendly fascism was articulated in 1985 in Bertram Gross's book, 'Friendly Fascism: The New
            Face of Power in America', in which he argued that if fascism came to the United States 
            it would not embody the same characteristics associated with fascist forms in the historical 
            past. There would be no Nuremberg rallies, doctrines of racial superiority, government-sanc­tioned 
            book burnings, death camps, genocidal purges, or the abrogation of the U.S. 
            Constitution. In short, fascism would not take the form of an ideological grid from 
            the past simply downloaded onto another country under different historical con­ditions.</p>
            
            <p>Gross believed that fascism was an ongoing danger and had the ability to 
            become relevant under new conditions, taking on familiar forms of thought that 
            res­onate with nativist traditions, experiences, and political relations.<sup>13</sup> Similarly, 
            in his 'Anatomy of Fascism,' Robert O. Paxton argued that the texture of American fascism 
            would not mimic traditional European forms but would be rooted in the language, 
            symbols, and culture of everyday life. He writes: "No swastikas in an American 
            fas­cism, but Stars and Stripes (or Stars and Bars) and Christian crosses. No fascist 
            salute, but mass recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance. These symbols contain no 
            whispers of fascism in themselves, of course, but an American fascism would transform 
            them into obligatory litmus tests for detecting the internal enemy."<sup>14</sup> It is worth 
            not­ing that Umberto Eco, in his discussion of "eternal fascism," also argued that any 
            updated version of fascism would not openly assume the mantle of historical 
            fas­cism; rather, new forms of authoritarianism would appropriate some of its elements, 
            making it virtually unrecognizable from its traditional forms. Like Gross and 
            Paxton, Eco contended that fascism, if it comes to America, will have a different 
            guise, although it will be no less destructive of democracy. He wrote:</p>
            
          <blockquote>
            <p>Ur-Fascism [Eternal Fascism] is still around us, sometimes in plainclothes. It would be 
            much easier for us if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying, "I want to 
            reopen Auschwitz, I want the Blackshirts to parade again in the Italian squares." Life 
            is not that sim­ple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises. Our 
            duty is to uncov­er it and to point our finger at any of its new instances-every day, 
            in every part of the world.<sup>15</sup></p>

          <p>The renowned political theorist Sheldon Wolin, in Democracy Incorporated updates 
            these views and argues persuasively that the United States has produced its own 
            unique form of authoritarianism, which he calls "inverted totalitarianism."<sup>16</sup> Wolin 
            claims that under traditional forms of totalitarianism, there are usually founding texts 
            such as Mein Kampf rule by a personal demagogue such as Adolf Hitler, political 
            change enacted by a revolutionary movement such as the Bolsheviks, the constitu­tion 
            rewritten or discarded, the political state's firm control over corporate interests, 
            and an idealized and all-encompassing ideology used to create a unified and total­izing 
            understanding of society. At the same time, the government uses all the power of its 
            cultural and repressive state apparatuses to fashion followers in its own ideological 
            image and collective identity.</p>
          <p>In the United States, Wolin argues that an emerging authoritarianism appears 
            to take on a very different form.<sup>17</sup> In addition to a charismatic leader, the government 
            is also governed through the anonymous and largely remote hand of corporate 
            power and finance capital. Political sovereignty is largely replaced by economic 
            sov­ereignty as corporate power takes over the reins of governance. The dire 
            conse­quence, as David Harvey points out, is that "raw money power wielded by the 
            few undermines all semblances of democratic governance. The pharmaceutical 
            compa­nies, health insurance and hospital lobbies, for example, spent more than $133 
            mil­lion in the first three months of 2009 to make sure they got their way on health 
            care reform in the United States."<sup>18</sup> The more money influences politics the more 
            cor­rupt the political culture becomes. Under such circumstances, holding office 
            is largely dependent on having huge amounts of capital at one's disposal, while laws 
            and policies at all levels of government are mostly fashioned by lobbyists 
            represent­ing big business corporations and commanding financial institutions. Moreover, 
            as the politics of health care reform indicate, such lobbying, as corrupt and unethical 
            as it may be, is not carried out in the open and displayed by insurance and drug com­panies 
            as a badge of honor-a kind of open testimonial to the disrespect for demo­cratic 
            governance and a celebration of their power. The subversion of democratic governance 
            in the United States by corporate interests is captured succinctly by Chris Hedges in 
            his observation that;</p>
            
          <blockquote>
            <p>Corporations have 35,000 lobbyists in Washington and thousands more in state capitals that 
            dole out corporate money to shape and write legislation. They use their political action 
            committees to solicit employees and shareholders for donations to fund pliable candidates. 
            The 'financial sector, for example, spent more than $5 billion on political campaigns, 
            influenc[e] peddling and lobbying during the past decade, which resulted in sweeping 
            deregulation, the gouging of consumers, our global financial meltdown and the subsequent 
            looting of the U.S. Treasury The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America spent 
            $26 million last year and clmg companies such as Pfizer, Amgen and Eli Lilly kicked in tens 
            of millions more to buy off the two parties. These corporations have made sure our so-called 
            health reform bil] will force us to buy their predatory and defective products. The oil and 
            gas indus­try, the coal industry; defense contractors and telecommunications companies have 
            thwart­ed the drive for sustainable energy and orchestrated the steady erosion of civil 
            liberties. Politicians do corporate bidding and stage hollow acts of political theater to 
            keep the fic­tion of the democratic state alive.<sup>19</sup></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Rather than being forced to adhere to a particular state ideology, the general 
            pub­lic in the United States is largely depoliticized through the influence of 
            corporations over schools, higher education, and other cultural apparatuses. The 
            deadening of public values, civic consciousness, and critical citizenship is also 
            the result of the work of anti-public intellectuals representing right-wing ideological 
            and financial inter­ests,<sup>20</sup> dominant media that are largely center-right, and a 
            market-driven public pedagogy that reduces the obligations of citizenship to the 
            endless consumption and discarding of commodities. In addition, a pedagogy of 
            social and political amnesia works through celebrity culture and its counterpart in 
            corporate-driven news, tele­vision, radio, and entertainment to produce a culture of 
            stupidity, censorship, and diversionary spectacles.</p>

          Freedom<br>
          and<br>
          Agency</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Agency is now defined by a neoliberal concept of Eeedom, a notion that is largely
            organized according to the narrow notions of individual self-interest and limited to
            the freedom from constraints. Central to this concept is the freedom to pursue one's
            self-interests independently of larger social concerns. For individuals in a con­sumer
            society, this often means the freedom to shop, own guns, and define rights
            without regard to the consequences for others or the larger social order. When
            applied to economic institutions, this notion of freedom often translates into a call
            for removing government regulation over the market and economic institutions. This
            notion of a deregulated and privatized Heedom is decoupled from the common good
            and any understanding of individual and social responsibility. It is an unlimited
            notion of freedom that both refuses to recognize the importance of social costs and
            social consequences and has no language for an ethic that calls us beyond ourselves,
            that engages our responsibility to others. Within this discourse of hyper-individu­alized 
            freedom, individuals are not only "liberated from the constraints imposed by
            the dense network of social bonds," but are also "stripped of the protection which
            had been matter-of-factly offered in the past by that dense network of social
            bonds."<sup>21</sup></p>

          <p>Freedom exclusively tied to personal and political rights without also enabling
            access to economic resources becomes morally empty and politically dysfunction­al. 
            The much-heralded notion of choice associated with personal and political freedom­ 
            is hardly assured when individuals lack the economic resources, knowledge, and 
            social supports to make such choices and freedoms operative and meaningful. As
            Zygmunt Bauman points out, "The right to vote (and so, obliquely and at least in
            theory, the right to influence the composition of the ruler and the shape of the rules 
            that bind the ruled) could be meaningfully exercised only by those 'who possess 
            suf­ficient economic and cultural resources' to be 'safe from the voluntary or involun­tary 
            servitude that cuts off any possible autonomy of choice (and/or its delegation)
            at the root... [Choice] stripped of economic resources and political power hardly
            assure [s] personal freedoms to the dzlvpossessed, who have no claim on the resources
            without which personal freedom can neither be won nor in practice enjoyed."<sup>22</sup> Paul
            Bigioni has argued that this flawed notion of freedom played a central role in the
            emerging fascist dictatorships of the early twentieth century. He writes:</p>
            
          <blockquote>
            <p>It was the liberals of that era who clamored for unfettered personal and economic freedom,
            no matter what the cost to society. Such untrammeled freedom is not suitable to civilized
            humans. It is the freedom of the jungle. In other words, the strong have more of it than the
            weak. It is a notion of freedom that is inherently violent, because it is enjoyed at the expense
            of others. Such a notion of freedom legitimizes each and every increase in the wealth and
            power of those who are already powerful, regardless of the misery that will be suffered by
            others as a result. The use of the state to limit such "freedom" was denounced by the lais­
            sez-faire liberals of the early 20th century. The use of the state to protect such 
            "freedom" was fascism. Just as monopoly is the ruin of the free market, fascism is the 
            ultimate degradation of liberal capitalism."<sup>23</sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This stripped-down notion of market-based freedom that now dominates American 
            society cancels out any viable notion of individual and social agency. This market­
            driven notion of freedom emphasizes choice as an economic function defined
            largely as the right to buy things while at the same time cancelling out any active
            understanding of freedom and choice as the right to make rational choices concern­ing
            the very structure of power and governance in a society. In embracing a passive
            attitude toward freedom in which power is viewed as a necessary evil, a conserva­tive
            notion of freedom reduces politics to the empty ritual of voting and is incapable
            of understanding freedom as a form of collective, productive power that enables "a
            notion of political agency and freedom that affirms the equal opportunity of all to
            exercise political power in order to participate in shaping the most important 
            deci­sions affecting their lives."<sup>24</sup> This merging of the market-based understanding of
            freedom as the freedom to consume and the conservative-based view of freedom as
            a restriction from all constraints refuses to recognize that the conditions for 
            sub­stantive freedom do not lie in personal and political rights alone; on the contrary, 
            real choices and freedom include the individual and collective ability to actively 
            intervene in and shape both the nature of politics and the myriad forces bearing 
            down on everyday life-a notion of freedom that can only be viable when social 
            rights and economic resources are available to individuals. Of course, this notion of
            freedom and choice is often dismissed either as a vestige of socialism or simply
            drowned out in a culture that collapses all social considerations and notions of 
            sol­idarity into the often cruel and swindle-based discourse of instant gratification and
            individual gain. Under such conditions, democracy is managed through the empty
            ritual of elections; citizens are largely rendered passive observers as a result of 
            giv­ing undue influence to corporate power in shaping all of the essential elements of 
            political governance and decision making; and manufactured appeals to fear and per­sonal
            safety legitimate both the suspension of civil liberties and the expanding powers of an
            imperial presidency and the policing functions of a militaristic state.</p>

          <p>I believe that the formative culture necessary to create modes of education,
            thought, dialogue, critique, and critical agency-the necessary conditions of any
            aspiring democracy-is largely destroyed through the pacification of intellectuals
            and the elimination of public spheres capable of creating such a culture. Elements
            of a depoliticizing and commodifying culture become clear in the shameless pro­paganda

            games that trade endlessly in images of violence, spectacles of consumption, and 
            stupifying modes of (il)literacy Funded by right-wing ideolog­ical, corporate, and 
            militaristic interests, an army of anti-public intellectuals groomed in right-wing 
            think tanks and foundations, such as the American Enterprise Institute and Manhattan 
            Institute, dominate the traditional media, police the uni­versities for any vestiges 
            of critical thought and dissent, and endlessly spread their message of privatization, 
            deregulation, and commercialization, exercising a power­ of influence in the 
            dismantling of all public spheres not dominated by private and corporate interests. 
            These "experts in legitimation," to use Antonio Gramsci's prescient phrase, peddle 
            civic ignorance just as they renounce any vestige of public accountability for big 
            business, giant media conglomerates, and financial megacor­porations. How else to 
            explain that nearly twenty percent of the American people believe incorrectly that 
            Obama is a Muslim!
          </p>

          <p>Under the new authoritarianism, the corporate state and the punishing state 
            merge as economics drives politics, and repression is increasingly used to contain 
            all those individuals and groups caught in an expanding web of destabilizing 
            inequality and powerlessness that touches everything from the need for basic health 
            care, food, and shelter to the promise of a decent education. As the social state is 
            hollowed out under pressure from free-market advocates, right-wing politicians, and 
            conservative ideologues, the United States has increasingly turned its back on any 
            semblance of social justice, civic responsibility, and democracy itself. This might 
            explain the influential journalist Thomas Friedman's shameless endorsement of military­ 
            adventurism in the New York Times article in which he argues that "The hid­den hand 
            of the market will never work without a hidden fist-McDonald's cannot flourish 
            without McDonnell Douglas, the designer of the U. S. Air Force F-15. And the hidden 
            fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley's technologies to flour­ish is 
            called the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps."<sup>25</sup> Freedom in this 
            discourse is inextricably wedded to state and military violence and is a far cry from 
            any semblance of a claim to democracy.</p>

        and the<br>
        Culture of<br>
        Cruelty</h2>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p>Another characteristic of an emerging authoritarianism in the United States is the 
            correlation between the growing atomization of the individual and the rise of a cul­ture 
            of cruelty, a type of zombie politics in which the living dead engage in forms 
            of rapacious behavior that destroy almost every facet of a substantive democratic 
            polity. There is a mode of terror rooted in a neoliberal market-driven society that 
            numbs many people just as it wipes out the creative faculties of imagination, mem­ory 
            and critical thought. Under a regime of privatized utopias, hyper-individual­ism, and 
            ego-centered values, human beings slip into a kind of ethical somnolence, indifferent 
            to the plight and suffering of others. Though writing in a different con­text, the 
            late Franléurt School theorist Leo Lowenthal captured this mode of ter­ror in his 
            comments on the deeply sedimented elements of authoritarianism rooted in modern 
            civilization. He wrote:
          </p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>In a system that reduces life to a chain of disconnected reactions to shock, personal 
            com­munication tends to lose all meaning...The individual under terrorist conditions 
            is never alone and always alone. He becomes numb and rigid not only in relation to 
            his neighbor but also in relation to himself; fear robs him of the power of spontaneous 
            emotional or mental reaction. Thinking becomes a stupid crime; it endangers his life. 
            The inevitable conse­quence is that stupidity spreads as a contagious disease among the 
            terrorized population. Human beings live in a state of stupor, in a moral coma.<sup>26</sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Implicit in Lowenthal's commentary is the assumption that as democracy becomes
            a fiction, the moral mechanisms of language, meaning, and ethics collapse, and a
            cruel indifference takes over diverse modes of communication and exchange, often
            as a register of the current paucity of democratic values, identities, and social 
            rela­tions. Surely, this is obvious today as all vestiges of the social compact, social 
            responsibility, and modes of solidarity give way to a form of Social Darwinism with 
            its emphasis on ruthlessness, cruelty, war, violence, hyper modes of masculinity, and 
            a disdain for those considered weak, dependent, alien, or economically unproductive. A 
            poverty of civic ideals is matched not only by a poverty of critical agency but also by 
            the disappearance among the public of the importance of moral and social responsibilities. 
            As public life is commercialized and commodified, the pathology of individual entitlement 
            and narcissism erodes those public spaces in which the con­ditions for conscience, decency, 
            self-respect, and dignity take root. The delusion of endless growth coupled with an 
            "obsession with wealth creation, the cult of priva­tization [and] uncritical admiration 
            for unfettered markets, and disdain for the pub­lic sector" has produced a culture that 
            seems "consumed by locusts" in "an age of pygmies."<sup>27</sup></p>

          <p>This culture of cruelty is especially evident in the hardships and deprivations 
            now visited upon many young people in the United States. We have 13.3 million 
            homeless children; one child in five lives in poverty; too many are now under the 
            supervision of the criminal justice system, and many more young adults are unem­ployed 
            and lack any hope for the future.<sup>28</sup> Moreover, we are subjecting more and more 
            children to psychiatric drugs as a way of controlling their alleged unruly behavior 
            while providing huge profits for drug companies. As Evelyn Pringle points out, 
            "in 2006 more money was spent on treating mental disorders in children aged 0 to 17 
            than for any other medical condition, with a total of $8.9 billion."<sup>29</sup></p>
            
          <p>Needless to say, the drugging of American children is less about treating genuine
            mental disorders than it is about punishing so-called unruly children, largely 
            chil­dren of the poor, while creating "lifelong patients and repeat customers for 
            Pharma!"<sup>30</sup> Stories abound about poor young people being raped, beaten, and dying 
            in juvenile detention centers, needlessly trafficked into the criminal justice 
            sys­tem as part ofa profit-making scheme cooked up by corrupt judges and private 
            cor­rection facilities administrators, and being given powerful antipsychotic medicines 
            in schools and other state facilities.<sup>31</sup> Unfortunately, this regression to sheer 
            Economic Darwinism is not only evident in increasing violence against young people, 
            cutthroat reality TV shows, hate radio, and the Internet, it is also on Hill dis­play in 
            the discourse of government officials and politicians and serves as a regis­ter of the 
            prominence of both a kind of political infantilism and a culture of cruelty.

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Zombie Politics<br>

        Cruelty, ii</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>For instance, the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, stated in an inter­view 
            in February 2010 that "the best thing that happened to the education system 
            in New Orleans was Hurricane Katrina."<sup>32</sup> Duncan's point, beyond the incredible 
            inhumanity reflected in such a comment, was that it took a disaster that uprooted 
            thousands of individuals and families and caused enormous amounts of suffering 
            to enable the Obama administration to implement a massive educational system 
            pushing charter schools based on market-driven principles that disdain public 
            val­ues, if not public schooling itselfi This is the language of cruelty and zombie 
            politi­cians, a language indifferent to the ways in which people who suffer great 
            tragedies are expelled from their histories, narratives, and right to be human. Horrible 
            tragedies caused in part by government indifference are now covered up in the dis­course 
            and ideals inspired by the logic of the market. This mean and merciless streak was also 
            on display recently when Lieutenant Governor Andre Bauer, who is run­ning for the 
            Republican nomination for governor in South Carolina, stated that giv­ing people 
            government assistance was comparable to "feeding stray animals." The utterly derogatory 
            and implicitly racist nature of his remark became obvious in the statement that 
            followed: "You know why? Because they breed. You're facilitating the problem if you 
            give an animal or a person ample food supply. They will reproduce, especially ones 
            that don't think too much further than that. And so what you've got to do is you've 
            got to curtail that type of behavior. They don't know any better."<sup>33</sup></p>
          
          <p>Lowenthal's argument that in an authoritarian society "stupidity spreads as a 
            contagious disease" is evident in a statement made by Michele Bachmann, a Republican 
            congresswoman, who recently argued that "Americans should purchase [health] insurance 
            with their own tax-free money."<sup>34</sup> That 43 million Americans are without health 
            insurance because they cannot afford it seems lost on Bachmann, whose comments suggest 
            that these uninsured individuals, families, unemployed workers, and children are not 
            simply a disposable surplus but actually invisible and therefore unworthy of any 
            acknowledgment.</p>

          <p>The regressive politics and moral stupidity are also evident in the emergence 
            of right-wing extremists now taking over the Republican Party. This new and 
            aggressive political formation calls for decoupling market-driven financial institu­tions 
            from any vestige of political and governmental constraint, celebrates emotion 
            over reason, treats critical intelligence as a toxin possessed largely by elites, 
            wraps its sophomoric misrepresentations in an air of beyond-interrogation "we're 
            just folks" insularity, and calls for the restoration of a traditional, white, 
            Christian, male-dominated America.<sup>35</sup> Such calls embody elements of a racial panic 
            that are evident in all authoritarian movements and have increasingly become a 
            defining fea­ture of a Republican Party that has sided with far-right-wing thugs 
            and goon squads intent on disrupting any vestige of the democratic process. This 
            emerging authoritarian element in American political culture is embodied in the 
            wildly pop­ular media presence of Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck-right-wing extremists
            who share a contempt for reason and believe in organizing politics on the model of 
            war, unconditional surrender, personal insults, hyper-masculine spectacles, and the 
            complete destruction of one's opponent.
          </p>
          
          <p>The culture of cruelty, violence, and slander was on full display as the Obama 
            administration successfully passed a weak version of health care reform in 2010. 
            Stoked by a Republican Party that has either looked away or in some cases support­ed 
            the coded language of racism and violence, it was no surprise that there was bare­ly a 
            peep out of Republican Party leaders when racial and homophobic slurs were hurled 
            by Tea Party demonstrators at civil rights legend Jon Lewis and openly gay Barney 
            Frank, both finn supporters of the Obama health policies. Even worse is the nod to 
            trigger-happy right-wing advocates of violence that conservatives such as Sarah 
            Palin have suggested in their response to the passage of the health care bill.
            For instance, Frank Rich argues that;</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This bill that inspired G.O.P. congressmen on 
            the House floor to egg on disruptive protest­ers even as they were being evicted from 
            the gallery by the Capitol Police last Sunday. It's this bill that prompted a 
            congressman to shout "baby killer" at Bart Stupak, a staunch anti­abortion Democrat. 
            It's this bill that drove a demonstrator to spit on Emanuel Cleaver, a black 
            representative from Missouri. And it's this "middle-of-the-road" bill, as Obama 
            accurately calls it, that has incited an unglued firestorm of homicidal rhetoric, 
            from "Kill the bill!" to Sarah Palin's cry for her followers to "reload." At least 
            four of the House members hit with death threats or vandalism are among the 20 
            political targets Palin marks with rifle crosshairs on a map on her Facebook page.<sup>36</sup></p>

          <p>There is more at work here than the usual right-wing promotion of bigotry and 
            ignorance; there is the use of violent rhetoric and imagery that mimics the discourse 
            of terrorism reminiscent of Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh, dangerous right­ 
            wing militia groups, and other American-style fascists. As Chris Hedges insists, 
            "The language of violence always presages violence"<sup>37</sup> and fuels an authoritarian­ism 
            that feeds on such excesses and the moral coma that accompanies the inabili­ty of 
            a society to both question itself and imagine an alternative democratic order.
          </p>
          
          <p>How else can one read the "homicidal rhetoric" that is growing in America as any­ 
            thing other than an obituary for dialogue, democratic values, and civic courage? 
            What does it mean for a democracy when the general public either supports or is 
            silent in the face of widely publicized events such as black and gay members of 
            Congress being subjected to racist and homophobic taunts, a black congressman 
            being spit on, and the throwing of bricks through the office windows of some 
            leg­islators who supported the health care bill? What does it mean for a democracy 
            when there is little collective outrage when Sarah Palin, a leading voice in the 
            Republican Party, mimics the tactics of vigilantes by posting a map with crosshairs 
            on the districts of Democrats and urges her supporters on with the shameliil slo­gan 
            "Don't Retreat. Instead-RELOADF' Under such circumstances, the brandish­ing of assault 
            weapons at right-wing political rallies, the posters and signs comparing Obama to 
            Hitler, and the ever-increasing chants to "Take Our Country Back" echoes what 
            Frank Rich calls a "small-scale mimicry of K.ristallnacht."<sup>38</sup> Violence and aggression 
            are now openly tolerated and in some cases promoted. The chants, insults, violence, 
            and mob hysteria all portend a dark period in American history­ an historical 
            conjuncture in the death knell for democracy is being written as the media turn 
            such events into spectacles rather than treat them as morally and politically 
            repugnant acts more akin to the legacy of fascism than the ideals of an aspir­ing 
            democracy. All the while the public yawns or, more troubling, engages fantasies 
            of reloading.
          </p>
          
          <p>Unfortunately, the problems now facing the United States are legion and fur­ther 
            the erosion of a civic and democratic culture. Some of the most glaring issues 
            are massive unemployment; a rotting infrastructure; the erosion of vital public 
            ser­vices; the dismantling of the social safety net; expanding levels of poverty, 
            especial­ly for children; and an imprisonment binge largely affecting poor 
            minorities of color. But such a list barely scratches the surface. In addition, 
            we have witnessed in the last thirty years the restructuring of public education 
            as either a source of profit for corporations or an updated version of control 
            modeled after prison culture coupled with an increasing culture of lying, cruelty, 
            and corruption, all of which belie a demo­cratic vision of America that now seems 
            imaginable only as a nostalgic rendering of the founding ideals of democracy.

          Democracy?</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Needless to say, many would disagree with Wolin's view that the United States is 
            in the grip of a new and dangerous authoritarianism that makes a mockery of the 
            country's moral claim to being a model of democracy at home and for the rest of 
            the world. For instance, liberal critic Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor 
            under President Bill Clinton, refers to America's changing political landscape as a 
            "shrinking democracy."<sup>39</sup> For Reich, democracy necessitates three things: "(1)
            Important decisions are made in the open. (2) The public and its representatives have 
            an opportunity to debate them, so the decisions can be revised in light of what the 
            public discovers and wants. And (3) those who make the big decisions are account­able 
            to voters."<sup>40</sup> If we apply Reich's notion of democracy, then it becomes evident
            that the use of the term democracy is neither theoretically apt nor politically 
            fea­sible at the current historical moment as a description of the United States. All of 
            the conditions he claims are crucial for a democracy are now undermined by finan­cial 
            and economic interests that control elections, buy off political representatives, 
            and eliminate those public spheres where real dialogue and debate can take place.</p>

          <p>It is difficult to imagine that anyone looking at a society in which an ultra-rich 
            finan­cial elite and megacorporations have the power to control almost every aspect of 
            pol­itics-from who gets elected to how laws are enacted-could possibly mistake this 
            social order and system of government for a democracy A more appropriate under­ 
            standing of democracy comes from Wolin in his claim that;</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Democracy is about the conditions that make it possible for ordinary people to better 
            their lives by becoming political beings and by making power responsive to their hopes 
            and needs. What is at stake in democratic politics is whether ordinary men and women 
            can rec­ognize that their concerns are best protected and cultivated under a regime whose 
            actions are governed by principles of commonality, equality, and faimess, a regime in 
            which taking part in politics becomes a way of staking out and sharing in a common life 
            and its forms of self-fulfillment. Democracy is not about bowling together but about 
            managing together those powers that immediately and significantly affect the lives and 
            circumstances of others and one's self Exercising power can be humbling when the 
            consequences are palpable rather than statistical-and rather different from wielding 
            power at a distance, at, say, an "undisclosed bunker somewhere in northem Virginia."<sup>41</sup></p>
          </blockquote>
        
          <p>Wolin ties democracy not merely to participation and accountability but to the
            importance of the formative culture necessary for critical citizens and the need for 
            a redistribution of power and wealth, that is, a democracy in which power is exer­cised 
            not just for the people by elites but by the people in their own collective inter­ests.
            But more importantly, Wolin and others recognize that the rituals of voting 
            and accountability have become empty in a country that has been reduced to a lock­ 
            down universe in which torture, abuse, and the suspension of civil liberties have 
            become so normalized that more than half of all Americans now support the use 
            of torture under some circumstances."<sup>42</sup> Torture, kidnapping, indefinite detention, 
            murder, and disappeared "enemy combatants" are typical practices carried out in 
            dic­tatorships, not in democracies, especially in a democracy that allegedly has a 
            liber­al president whose election campaign ran on the promise of change and hope. 
            Maybe it's time to use a different language to name and resist the registers of 
            power and ideology that now dominate American society.</p>

            def­inition. What is to be noted is that many scholars, such as Kevin Passmore and 
            Robert O. Paxton, agree that authoritarianism is a mass movement that emerges out 
            of a failed democracy; and its ideology is extremely anti-liberal, anti-democratic, 
            and anti-socialistic.<sup>43</sup> As a social order, it is generally characterized by a system 
            of ter­ror directed against perceived enemies of the state; a monopolistic control of 
            the mass media; an expanding prison system; a state monopoly of weapons; political 
            rule by privileged groups and classes; control of the economy by a limited number 
            of peo­ple; unbridled corporatism; "the appeal to emotion and myth rather than reason; 
            the gloriiication of violence on behalf of a national cause; the mobilization and 
            milita­rization of civil society; [and] an expansionist foreign policy intended to 
            promote national greatness."<sup>44</sup> All of these tendencies were highly visible during 
            the former Bush administration. With the election of Barack Obama to the presidency, 
            there was a widespread feeling among large sections of the American public and its 
            intellectuals that the threat of authoritarianism had passed. And yet there are many 
            troubling signs that in spite of the election of Obama, authoritarian policies not 
            only continue to unfold unabated within his administration but continue outside of 
            his power to control them. In this case, antidemocratic forces seem to align with 
            many of the conditions that make up what Wolin calls the politics of inverted 
            totalitari­anism.</p>

          <p>I think it is fair to say that authoritarianism can permeate the lived relations of
            a political culture and social order and can be seen in the ways in which such rela­tions 
            exacerbate the material conditions of inequality, undercut a sense of individ­ual and 
            social agency, hijack democratic values, and promote a deep sense of hopelessness, 
            cynicism, and eventually unbridled anger. This deep sense of cynicism and despair 
            on the part of the polity in the face of unaccountable corporate and polit­ical power 
            lends credence to Hannah Arendt's notion that at the heart of totalitar­ianism is 
            the disappearance of the thinking, dialogue, and speaking citizens who make politics 
            possible. Authoritarianism as both an ideology and a set of social prac­tices emerges 
            within the lives of those marked by such relations, as its proponents scorn the 
            present while calling for a revolution that rescues a deeply anti-modernist past in 
            order to revolutionize the future.</p>

          <p>Determining for certain whether we are in the midst of a new authoritarian­ism 
            under the leadership of Barack Obama is difficult, but one thing is clear: any 
            new form of authoritarianism that emerges in the current time will be much more 
            powerful and complex in its beliefs, mechanisms of power, and modes of control than 
            the alleged idealism of one man or one administration. The popular belief, especially ­
            after McCain's defeat, was that the country had made a break with its morally 
            transgressive and reactionary past and that Obama signmed not just hope but 
            political redemption. Such views ignored both the systemic and powerfully orga­nized 
            financial and economic forces at work in American society while vastly over­ 
            estimating the power of any one individual or isolated group to challenge and 
            transform them. Even as the current economic meltdown revealed the destructive 
            and distinctive class character of the fmancial crisis, the idea that the crisis 
            was root­ed in systemic causes that far exceeded a few bailouts was lost even on 
            liberal econ­omists such as Paul Krugman,]effrey Sachs, and Joseph Stiglitz.</p>

          <p>Within such economic analyses and narratives of political redemption, the
            primacy of hope and "critical exuberance" took precedence over the reality of 
            estab­lished corporate power, ideological interests, and the influence of the 
            military­ industrial complex. As Judith Butler warned soon after Obama's victory, 
            "Obama is, after all, hardly a leftist, regardless of the attributions of 
            'socialism' proffered by his conservative opponents. ln what ways will his 
            actions be constrained by party politics, economic interests, and state power; 
            in what ways have they been compro­mised already? If we seek through this 
            presidency to overcome a sense of dissonance, then we will have jettisoned 
            critical politics in favor of an exuberance whose phan­tasmatic dimensions 
            will prove consequential."<sup>45</sup> In retrospect, Butler's comments have proven 
            prescient, and the hope that accompanied Obama's election has now been 
            tempered by not simply despair but in many quarters outright and legitimate 
            anger.</p>

          <p>If Bush's presidency represented an exceptional anti-democratic moment, it 
            would seem logical that the Obama administration would have examined, 
            con­demned, and dismantled policies and practices at odds with the ideals of 
            an aspir­ing democracy Unfortunately such has not been the case under Obama, at 
            least up to this point in his administration. Within the past few years, Obama 
            has moved decidedly to the right, and in doing so has extended some of the 
            worst elements of the counter-terrorism policies of the Bush administration. 
            He has endorsed the use of military commissions, argued for the use of 
            indefinite detention with no charges or legal recourse for Afghan prisoners, 
            extended the USA Patriot Act,<sup>46</sup> continued two wars while expanding the war in 
            Afghanistan, and largely reproduced Bush's market-driven approach to school 
            reform.<sup>47</sup> As Noam Chomsky points out, Obama has done nothing to alter the 
            power and triumph of financial liberalization in the past thirty years.<sup>48</sup> He 
            bailed out banks and financial investment institutions at the expense of the 
            26.3 million Americans who are either unemployed or do not have full-time 
            jobs along with the millions who have lost their homes. His chief econom­ic 
            and foreign policy advisors-Tim Geithner, Lawrence Summers, and Robert 
            Gates-represent a continuation of a military and big business orientation 
            that is central to the ideologies and power relations of a undemocratic and 
            increasingly bankrupt economic and political system. While claiming to enact 
            policies designed to reduce the federal deficit, Obama plans to cut many 
            crucial domestic programs while increasing military spending, the intelligence 
            budget, and foreign military aid.</p>

          <p>Obama has requested a defense budget for 2011 of $708 billion, in addition to 
            call­ing for $33 billion to finance the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This budget is 
            almost as large as the rest of the entire world's defense spending combined. Roger Hodge
            provides a useful summary of Obama's failings, extending from the perversion of
            the rule of law to the authoritarian claim of "sovereign immunity." He writes:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Obama promised to end the war in Iraq, end torture, close Guantanamo, restore the 
            con­stitution, heal our wounds, and wash our feet. None of these things has come to 
            pass. As pres­ident, with few exceptions, Obama either has embraced the unconstitutional 
            war powers claimed by his predecessor or has left the door open for their quiet adoption 
            at some later date. Leon Panetta, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has 
            declared that the right to kidnap (known as "extraordinary rendition") foreigners will 
            continue, just as the Bush administrations expansive doctrine of state secrets continues 
            to be used in court against those wrongfully detained and tortured by our security forces 
            and allies. Obama has adopted mil­itary commissions, once an unpardonable offense against 
            our best traditions, to prosecute ter­rorism cases in which legitimate convictions cannot 
            be obtained .... The principle of habeas corpus, sacred to candidate Obama as "the essence 
            of who we are," no longer seems so essen­tial, and reports continue to surface of secret 
            prisons hidden from due process and the Red Cross. Waterboarding has been banned, but 
            other "soft" forms of torture, such as sleep depri­vation and force-feeding, continue-as 
            do the practices, which once seemed so terribly important to opponents of the Bush regime, 
            of presidential signing statements and warrant­less surveillance. In at least one respect, 
            the Obama Justice Department has produced an innovation: a claim of "sovereign immunity" 
            in response to a lawsuit seeking damages for ille­gal spying. Not even the minions of 
            George W. Bush, with their fanciful notions of the uni­tary executive, made use of this 
            constitutionally suspect doctrine, derived from the ancient common-law assumption that 
            "the King can do no wrong," to defend their clear violations of the federal surveillance 
            statute.<sup>49</sup></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Moreover, by giving corporations and unions unlimited freedom to contribute to 
            elections, the recent Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election 
            Commission provided a final step in placing the control of politics more firmly in the 
            hands of big money and large corporations. In this ruling, democracy-like every­thing 
            else in American culture-was treated as a commodity and offered up to the highest 
            bidder. As a result, whatever government regulations are imposed on big business and 
            the financial sectors will be largely ineffective and will do little to dis­rupt casino 
            capitalism's freedom from political, economic, and ethical constraints. Chris Hedges 
            is right in insisting that the Supreme Court's decision "carried out a coup d'état in 
            slow motion. The coup is over. We lost. The ruling is one more judi­cial effort to 
            streamline mechanisms for corporate control. It exposes the myth of a functioning 
            democracy and the triumph of corporate power....The corporate state is firmly cemented 
            in place."<sup>50</sup></p>

          <p>In light of his conservative, if not authoritarian, policies, Obama's once-inspir­ing 
            call for hope has been reduced to what appears to be simply an empty performance, 
            one that "favours the grand symbolic gesture over deep structural change every time."<sup>51</sup> 
            What once appeared as inspired rhetoric has largely been reduced to fodder for 
            late-night television comics, while for a growing army of angry voters it 
            has become nothing more than a cheap marketing campaign and disingenuous 
            diversion in support of moneyed interests and power. Obama's rhetoric of hope is 
            largely contradicted by policies that continue to reproduce a world of egotistic 
            self-referentiality, an insensitivity to human suffering, massive investments in 
            mil­itary power, and an embrace of those market-driven values that produce enormous 
            inequalities in wealth, income, and security. There is more at stake here than a 
            pol­itics of misrepresentation and bad faith. There is an invisible register of politics that 
            goes far beyond the contradiction between Obama's discourse and his right-wing 
            policies. What we must take seriously in Obama's policies is the absence of anything 
            that might suggest a fundamental power shift away from casino capitalism to poli­cies 
            that would develop the conditions "that make it possible for ordinary people 
            to better their lives by becoming political beings and by making power responsive 
            to their hopes and needs."<sup>52</sup> In Obama's world, cutthroat competition is still the 
            name of the game, and individual choice is still simply about a hunt for bargains.</p>

          <p>Lost here is any notion of political and social responsibility for the welfare, auton­omy, 
            and dignity of all human beings but especially those who are marginalized 
            because they lack food, shelter,jobs, and other crucial basic needs. But then again, 
            this is not Obama's world; it is a political order and mode of economic sovereign­ty 
            that has been in the making for quite some time and now shapes practically every 
            aspect of culture, politics, and civic life. In doing so it has largely destroyed any 
            ves­tige of real democracy in the United States.</p>

          <p>I am not suggesting that in light of Obama's continuation of some of the 
            deeply structured authoritarian tendencies in American society that people should 
            turn away from the language of hope, but I am saying that they should avoid a notion 
            of hope that is as empty as it is disingenuous. What is needed is a language of 
            cri­tique and hope that mutually inform each other, and engagement in a discourse of 
            hope that is concretely rooted in real struggles and capable of inspiring a new 
            political language and collective vision among a highly conservative and fractured 
            polity. Maybe it is time to shift the critique of Obama away from an exclusive focus 
            on the policies and practices of his administration and develop a new language, one 
            with a longer historical purview and deeper understanding of the ominous forces 
            that now threaten any credible notion of the United States as an aspiring democ­racy. 
            As Stuart Hall insists, we "need to change the scale of magnification" in order to make 
            visible the anti-democratic relations often buried beneath the hidden order of politics 
            that have taken hold in the United States in the last few decades.<sup>53</sup></p>

          <p>It may be time to shift the discourse away from focusing on either Obama's failures 
            or progressives and others to develop "the organizational power to make mus­cular 
            demands"<sup>54</sup> on the Obama administration. Maybe the time has come to 
            focus on the ongoing repressive and systemic conditions, institutions, ideologies, and 
            values that have been developing in American society for the last thirty years, 
            forces that are giving rise to a unique form of American authoritarianism. I agree 
            with Sheldon Wolin that the "fixation upon" Obama now "obscures the problems" 
            we are facing.<sup>55</sup> Maybe it is time to imagine what democracy would look like out­ 
            side of what we have come to call capitalism, not simply neoliberalism at its most
            extreme manifestation. Maybe it is time to fight for the formative culture and 
            modes of thought and agency that are the very foundations of democracy. And 
            maybe it is time to mobilize a militant, far-reaching social movement to challenge 
            the false claims that equate democracy and capitalism.</p>

          <p>If it is true that a new form of authoritarianism is developing in the United 
            States, undercutting any vestige of a democratic society, then it is equally true 
            that there is nothing inevitable about this growing threat. The long and tightening grip
            of authoritarianism in American political culture can be resisted and transformed. 
            This dystopic fixture will not happen if intellectuals, workers, young people, and 
            diverse social movements unite to create the public spaces and unsettling formative 
            educational cultures necessary for reimagining the meaning of radical democracy.</p>
            
          <p>In part, this is a pedagogical project, one that recognizes consciousness, agency, and 
            education as central to any viable notion of politics. lt is also a project designed to 
            address, critique, and make visible the commonsense ideologies that enable neolib­eral 
            capitalism and other elements of an emergent authoritarianism to function 
            alongside a kind of moral coma and political amnesia at the level of everyday life.</p>

          <p>But such a project will not take place if the American public cannot recognize how 
            the mechanisms of authoritarianism have had an impact on their lives, restructured 
            negatively the notion of freedom, and corrupted power by placing it largely in the 
            hands of ruling elites, corporations, and different segments of the military and 
            national security state. Such a project must work to develop vigorous social spheres 
            and communities that promote a culture of deliberation, public debate, and critical 
            exchange across a wide variety of cultural and institutional sites in an effort to 
            gen­erate democratic movements for social change. Central to such a project is the 
            attempt to foster a new radical imagination as part of a wider political project to 
            cre­ate the conditions for a broad-based social movement that can move beyond the 
            legacy of a fractured lefd progressive culture and politics in order to address the total­ity 
            of the society's problems. This suggests fmding a common ground in which chal­lenging 
            diverse forms of oppression, exploitation, and exclusion can become part of 
            a broader challenge to create a radical democracy. We need to develop an educat­ed and 
            informed public-one that embraces a culture of questioning and puts into 
            question society's commanding institutions. Such a citizenry is crucial to the devel­opment 
            of a critical formative culture organized around a project of autonomy and 
            mode of politics in which, as Cornelius Castoriadis insists, broader concerns with 
            power and justice are connected to the need "to create citizens who are critical 
            thinkers capable of putting existing institutions into question so that democracy 
            again becomes society's movement.. .that is to say, a new type of regime in the full 
            sense of the term."<sup>56</sup> We live in a time that demands a discourse of both critique 
            and possibility, one that recognizes that without an informed citizenry, collective 
            struggle, and viable social movements, democracy will slip out of our reach and we 
            will arrive at a new stage of history marked by the birth of an authoritarianism that 
            not only disdains all vestiges of democracy but is more than willing to relegate it 
            to a distant memory.

          <p>This book was published just as the Obama administration finished its second year 
            in office. Initially, hopes were high among large segments of the American public. 
            The long dark years of war, repression, secrecy, and corruption were rejected by 
            pop­ular vote, and a brighter day seemed on the horizon, or so it seemed. Obama spoke 
            a political language that embodied hope, and his earnest embrace of the American 
            dream appeared to represent the possibility of a more just future. Under Bush, the 
            United States had come as close to authoritarianism as was possible without 
            giv­ing up all vestiges of democratic aspirations. The Bush/Cheney regime was the 
            apotheosis of a new kind of politics in American life, one in which the arrogance 
            of power and wealth transformed a limited social state into a mode of sovereignty 
            that not only worked in the interests of rich and powerful corporations but also 
            increasingly viewed more and more individuals and groups as disposable and 
            expendable. As politics came to occupy the center of life itself, the welfare state was 
            transformed into a corporate and punishing state. Problems were no longer viewed 
            as in need of social and political remedies. Instead, they were criminalized, reduced 
            to matters of law and order-when law and order weren't suspended altogether. The 
            defense of the common good, public values, and social protections moved from the 
            center of political culture to the margins-reduced to an inconvenience, if not a 
            threat to those who occupied the privileged precincts of power. In the midst of a 
            militarized culture of fear, insecurity and market-driven values, economics drove 
            pol­itics to its death-dealing limit, as crucial considerations of justice, ethics, and 
            com­passion were largely expunged from our political vocabulary, except as objects of 
            disdain or a weak-kneed liberal nostalgic yearning. It seemed as ifthe living dead 
            now ruled every commanding aspect of the culture, extending from the media to 
            popular expression itself.</p>

            <p>Tragically, little has changed since Barack Obama took office. The politics of 
            corruption, death, and despair appear to define the Obama administration as much 
            as they did the relentless eight years of the Bush regime. This book is an attempt 
            to develop a new form of political critique forged out of what may seem an extreme 
            metaphor, the zombie or hyper-dead. Yet the metaphor is particularly apt for 
            draw­ing attention to the ways in which political culture and power in American society 
            now working the interests of bare survival, if not disposability, for the vast majori­ty 
            of people-a kind of war machine and biopolitics committed to the creation of 
            death-worlds, a new and unique form of social existence in which large segments 
            of the population live under a state of siege, reduced to a form of social death. The 
            zombie metaphor does more than Suggest the symbolic face of power, it points 
            dra­matically to a kind of "mad agency that is power in a new form, death-in-life"<sup>57</sup> 
            agency without conscience and bereft of social democratic imagination or hope. This 
            is what Achille Mbembe calls necropolitics in which "death is the mediator of the 
            present-the only form of agency left."<sup>58</sup> What is new about this type of politics 
            is that it is not hidden, lurking in the shadows but appears daily and unremarkably 
            in memos, reports, and policies justifying illegal legalities such as the use of state 
            secrets, indefinite detention without charge, the massive incarceration of people of 
            color, hidden prisons, a world of night raids, the bailout of corrupt corporations that 
            led to the direct destitution of millions, and the full-fledged attack on a weakened 
            oppositional culture of thoughtfulness and critique, itself all but left for dead. The 
            figure of the zombie utilizes the iconography of the living dead to signal a society 
            that appears to have stopped questioning itself, that revels in its collusion with 
            human suffering, and is awash in a culture of unbridled materialism and narcissism. 
            Though not of his making, this is now Obama's challenge; and yet the politics of 
            death and suffering continue unabated both in the United States and in America's 
            imperial adventures abroad.</p>

          <p>This book is an attempt to understand critically both the political and 
            peda­gogical conditions that have produced this culture of sadism and death, attempt­ing 
            to mark and chart its visible registers, including the emergence of right-wing 
            teaching machines, a growing politics of disposability, the emergence of a culture 
            of cruelty, the ongoing war being waged on young people, and especially on youth 
            of color. The book begins and ends with an analysis of authoritarianism and the ways 
            it reworks itself; mutates, and attacks parasitically the desiccated shell of democra­cy, 
            sucking out its life-blood. The focus on authoritarianism serves as both a warn­ing 
            as well as a call to critical engagement in the interest of hope-not as a political 
            rhetoric emptied of context and commitment but one that seeks to resuscitate a 
            democratic imaginary and energized social movements that is the one antidote to 
            the zombification of politics.</p>

          <p>In the first section of the book, elements of the new authoritarianism are ana­lyzed 
            as a death-dealing politics that works its way through a culture of deceit, fear, 
            humiliation, torture, and market-driven desire for their ever-more "extreme" expres­sions. 
            Next it focuses on challenging the rise of a politics of illiteracy and the ongoing 
            destruction of democratic public spheres, stressing how the values of casino 
            capitalism are mobilized through the emergence of market-driven commercial 
            spheres and public institutions such as schools. The third section of the book focus­es 
            on the figure of youth as a register of the crisis of public values, signaling the 
            impending crisis of a democratic future. The merging of zombie politics and the 
            increasing scale of suffering and hardship that young people have to endure in the 
            United States points to the serious political and ethical consequences of a society 
            mobilized and controlled by casino capitalism-a capitalism that in its arrogance 
            and greed takes the side of death and destruction rather than siding with democ­racy 
            and public life. The figure of the zombie signifies not just a crisis of conscious­ness 
            but a new type of political power and "mad agency," visible in the rituals of 
            economic Darwinism that rule not just reality TV but everyday life. But such a pol­itics 
            is far from undefeatable, and surely it is not without the continued presence and 
            possibility of individual and collective resistance. My hope is that this book will break 
            through a diseased common sense that often masks zombie politicians, anti-pub­lic 
            intellectuals, politics, institutions, and social relations and bring into focus the 
            need for a new language, pedagogy, and politics in which the living dead will be 
            moved decisively to the margins rather than occupying the very center of politics and 
            everyday life.

        <article>
          <p>At present Americans are fascinated by a particular kind of monstrosity, by vampires 
            and zombies condemned to live an eternity by feeding off the souls of the living. The 
            preoccupation with such parasitic relations speaks uncannily to the threat most 
            Americans perceive from the shameless blood lust of contempo­rary captains of 
            industry, which Matt Taibbi, a writer for Rolling Stone, has aptly described as "a 
            great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relent­lessly jamming its 
            blood funnel into anything that smells like money."<sup>2</sup>
            Media cul­ture, as the enormous popularity of the Twilight franchise and HBO's 
            True Blood reveals, is nonetheless enchanted by this seductive force of such 
            omnipotent beings. More frightening, however, than the danger posed by these 
            creatures is the com­ing revolution enacted by the hordes of the unthinking, 
            caught in the spell of voodoo economics and compelled to acts of obscene violence 
            and mayhem. They are the living dead, or what I have labeled in the introduction 
            as the hyper-dead, whose contagion threatens the very life force of the nation.</p>

          <p>Only a decade or so ago, citizens feared the wrath of robots-terminators and 
            cyborgs who wanted to destroy us-the legacy of a highly rationalized, technocratic 
            culture that eludes human regulation, even comprehension. That moment has 
            passed, and we are now in the 2.0 phase of that same society where instrumental 
            rationality and technocracy threaten the planet as never before. But now, those who 
            are not part of a technocratic elite appear helpless and adrift, trapped in the grip of 
            a society that denies them any altemative sense of politics or hope. Caught in a soci­ety 
            increasingly marked by massive inequality and the divide between the privileged 
            spaces of gated communities and the dead space of "broken highways, bankrupt 
            cities, collapsing bridges, failed schools, the unemployed, the underpaid and the 
            uninsured,"<sup>3</sup> the armies of disposable populations are condemned to roam the 
            shattered American landscape with a blind and often unthinking rage.</p>

          <p>Zombies are invading al.most every aspect of our daily lives. Not only are the 
            flesh-chomping, blood-lusting, pale-faced creatures with mouths full of black goo 
            appearing in movie theaters, television series, and everywhere in screen culture as 
            shock advertisements, but these flesh-eating zombies have become an apt metaphor 
            for the current state of American politics. Not only do zombies portend a new aes­thetic 
            in which hyper-violence is embodied in the fonn ofa carnival of snarling crea­tures 
            engorging elements of human anatomy, but they also portend the arrival of a 
            revolting politics that has a ravenous appetite for spreading destruction and promot­ing 
            human suffering and hardship.<sup>4</sup> This is a politics in which cadres of the unthink­ing 
            and living dead promote civic catastrophes and harbor apocalyptic visions, 
            focusing more on death than life. Death-dealing zombie politicians and their 
            acolytes support modes of corporate and militarized governance through which 
            entire populations now become redundant, disposable, or criminalized. This is 
            especially true for poor minority youth, who as flawed consumers and unwanted 
            workers, are oH°ered the narrow choice of joining the military, going to prison, or 
            are simply being exiled into various dead zones in which they become socially 
            embedded and invisible.<sup>5</sup> Zombie values find expression in an aesthetic that is 
            aired daily in the mainstream media, a visual landscape filled with the spectacle of 
            destruction and decay wrought by human parasites in the form of abandoned hous­es, 
            cars, gutted cities and trashed businesses. There are no zombie-free spaces in this 
            version of politics. Paralyzed by fear, American society has become the site of a series 
            of planned precision attacks on constitutional rights, dissent, and justice itself 
            Torture, kidnappings, secret prisons, preventive detention, illegal domestic spying, 
            and the dissolution of habeas corpus have become the protocol of a newly fashioned 
            dystopian mode of governance. Zombie politics reveals much about the gory social 
            and political undercurrent of American society.</p>

          <p>This is a politics in which the undead-or, more aptly, the living dead-rule 
            and rail against any institution, set of values, and social relations that embrace the 
            common good or exhibit compassion for the suffering of others. Zombie politics 
            supports megacorporations that cannibalize the economy, feeding off taxpayer dollars 
            while undercutting much-needed spending for social services. The vampires of 
            Wall Street reach above and beyond the trajectories of traditional politics, 
            exercis­ing an influence that has no national or civic allegiance, displaying an 
            arrogance that is as unchecked as its power is unregulated. As Maureen Dowd has 
            pointed out, one particularly glaring example of such arrogance can be found in 
            Lloyd Blankfein's response to a reporter's question when he asked the chief of Goldman 
            Sachs if "it is possible to make too much money."<sup>6</sup> Blankfein responded by insisting, 
            without irony, that he-and I presume his fellow Wall Street vampires-were "doing God's 
            work,"<sup>7</sup> a response truly worthy of one of the high priests of voodoo economics who 
            feels no remorse and offers no apology for promoting a global financial crisis while 
            justifying a bloated and money-obsessed culture of greed and exploitation that has 
            caused enormous pain, suffering, and hardship for millions of people. Unfortunately, 
            victim to their own voodoo economics, the undead-along with their financial 
            insti­tutions, which were once barely breathing, keep coming back, even when it appears 
            that the zombie banks and investment houses have failed one last time, with no hope 
            of once again wreaking their destruction upon society.</p>

          <p>Zombie ideologies proliferate like the breathing, blood-lusting corpses in the 
            classic Night of tbe Living Dead. They spew out toxic gore that supports the 
            mar­ket as the organizing template for all institutional and social relations, mindlessly 
            compelled, it seems, to privatize everything and aim invective at the idea of big 
            gov­ernment but never at the notion of the bloated corporate and militarized state. 
            Zombie culture hates big government, a euphemism for the social state, but loves 
            big corporations and is infatuated with the ideology that, in zombieland, 
            unregu­lated banks, insurance companies, and other megacorporations should make major 
            decisions not only about governing society but also about who is privileged and who 
            is disposable, who should live and who should die. Zombie politics rejects the 
            wel­fare state for a hybridized corporate and punishing state. just as it views any 
            ves­tige of a social safety net as a sign of weakness, if not pathology, its central 
            message seems to be that we are all responsible for ourselves and that the war of 
            all against all is at the core of the apocalyptic vision that makes zombie politics 
            both appeal­ing as a spectacle and convincing as a politics. Zombie violence and 
            policies are everywhere, backed by an army of zombie economic advisors, lobbyists, 
            and legis­lators, all of whom seem to revel in spreading the culture of the undead 
            while feast­ing on the spread of war, human suffering, violence, and catastrophe 
            across the United States and the larger globe.</p>

          <p>Evidence of the long legacy of zombie politics and its death-dealing policies is 
            on full display as we move into the mid-stages of the Obama administration. Even 
            progressive zombie books such as Max Brooks's World War Z have a hard time 
            keep­ing up with the wrath of destruction overtaking American society, especially 
            as the mutually determining forces of economic inequality, corporate power, and a 
            growing punishing corporate state become the defining features of zombie politics 
            at the beginning of the new millennium. It is a millennium, in this case, marked by 
            a bur­geoning landscape filled with the wreckage of those populations now considered 
            excess, especially with regard to children, who are increasingly treated as one of the 
            most disposable populations. For instance, the Obama administration now labors 
            under the burden of death-dealing institutions and advisors, along with a predato­ry 
            market-driven economics that continues to produce an economic recession in 
            which over 13 million children live in poverty, 17 percent of poor children lack 
            insur­ance, nearly half of all children and 90 percent of black youth will be on 
            food stamps at some point in their youth, 45,000 people die every year because of a 
            lack of health insurance, 3.6 million elderly live in poverty, and more than 16 
            million people are unemployed. The violence of zombie politics is also evident in 
            the fact that more and more working- and middle-class youth and poor youth of color 
            find themselves confronted with either vastly diminishing opportunities or are fed 
            into an ever­ expanding system of disciplinary control that dehumanizes, medicalizes, 
            and crim­inalizes their behavior in multiple sites, extending fiom the home and school 
            to the criminal justice system-not, of course, devoured in order to be "integrated" 
            or "incorporated" into the system but rather ingested and vomited up, thus securing 
            the permanence of their exclusion.</p>

          <p>With the cruelest of ironies, zombie politics and culture invoke life as they 
            pro­mote death and human suffering. For example, zombie politicians who oppose the 
            welfare state, health care reform, investing in a quality education for all children, 
            rebuilding the nation's crumbling infrastructure, and creating a federally funded jobs 
            program for young people and the unemployed often argue that they oppose such 
            programs because they will saddle the next generation with a massive debt. And yet, 
            they have no regrets about funding wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that since 2001 
            have cost American taxpayers over $930 billion dollars. Nor is there any remorse for 
            supporting under the Clinton and Bush administrations massive tax breaks for the 
            rich that reduced government revenue by trillions of dollars. In their embrace of 
            mar­ket deregulation, do they say or do anything about a food industry "that is 
            spend­ing millions of dollars on slick digital marketing campaigns promoting fatty and 
            sugary products to teenagers and children on the Internet, on cell phones and even 
            inside video games-often without the knowledge of parents"?<sup>8</sup> Nor do the zombie 
            politicians utter a whisper about a country that is singularly responsible for jail­ing 
            over 2,500 juvenile offenders for life without the possibility of parole or address 
            the shameful fact that "just over 100 people in the world [are] serving sentences of 
            life without the possibility of parole for crimes they committed as juveniles in 
            which no one was killed [and that all] are in the United States."<sup>9</sup> Instead, zombie 
            politicians, blood-sucking C.E.O.s, and media pundits resort to deceit and 
            misrep­resentation while reproducing a culture of deception and cruelty. This is the 
            group that-even as they invoked death panels and denied their own morbid 
            predilec­tions-warned before the passing of the health care reform bill that such 
            legisla­tion was largely "stealthy reparations for slavery." And one true representative 
            of the hyper-dead, Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C, proclaimed without the slightest hint 
            of self-reflection that "there are no Americans who don't have health care."<sup>10</sup> Foxx 
            rates high as one of the zombie politicians spewing forth the kind of blood-soaked 
            venom that would make even the most hardened hyper-dead cringe. She has not 
            only argued that health care reform poses a greater threat to the United States than 
            "any terrorist right now in any country" She has also, as Joshua Holland points out, 
            insisted that health care reform "would be just like an ax-murderer crawling into the 
            room of a small, defenseless child in the dark of night, only much scarier."<sup>11</sup></p>

          <p>One of the cardinal policies of zombie politics is to redistribute wealth upward 
            to produce record-high levels of inequality, just as corporate power is simultaneous­ly 
            consolidated at a speed that threatens to erase the most critical gains made over 
            the last fifty years to curb the anti-democratic power of corporations. And yet this 
            uncritical celebration of market fundamentalism, with its profound disdain for the 
            common good, seems to revel in the human suffering caused by conditions of 
            endemic inequality, which as Tony ]udt rightly argues "is the pathology of the age 
            and the greatest threat to the health of any democracy."<sup>12</sup> Zombie policies aimed 
            at hollowing out the social state are now matched by an increase in repressive 
            leg­islation to curb the unrest that might explode among those populations falling 
            into the despair and suffering unleashed by a "savage, fanatical capitalism" that 
            consti­tutes a war against the public good, the welfare state, and "social citizenship."<sup>13</sup></p>

          <p>Deregulation, privatization, commodification, corporate mergers, and asset 
            stripping go hand in hand with the curbing of civil liberties, the increasing 
            crimi­nalization of social problems, and the fashioning of the prison as the 
            preeminent space of racial containment. (One in nine black males between the 
            ages of 20 and 34 is incarcerated.<sup>14</sup>) The alleged morality of market freedom 
            is now secured through the ongoing irnmorality of a militarized state that 
            embraces torture, war, and violence as legitimate functions of political 
            sovereignty and the ordering of daily life. As corporations increase their 
            profits and power, the rich get richer, and the reach of the punishing state 
            extends itself further, those forces and public spheres that once provided a 
            modicum of protection for workers, the poor, sick, aged, and young are undermined, 
            leaving large numbers of people impoverished and with lit­tle hope for the future.</p>

          <p>David Harvey refers to this primary feature of zombie politics as "accumula­tion 
            by dispossession,"<sup>15</sup> which encompasses the privatization and commodification 
            of public assets, deregulation of the financial sector, and the use of the state to 
            direct the flow of wealth upward through, among other practices, tax policies that 
            favor the rich and cut back the social wage. As Harvey points out, "All of these 
            process­es amount to the transfer of assets from the public and popular realms to 
            the pri­vate and class privileged domains"<sup>16</sup> and to the overwhelming of political 
            institu­tions by powerful corporations that keep them in check. Zygmunt Bauman goes 
            further and argues that not only do zombie politics and predatory capitalism draw 
            their life blood from the relentless process of asset stripping, but they also produce 
            "the acute crisis of the 'human waste' disposal industry, as each new outpost 
            con­quered by capitalist markets adds new thousands or millions to the mass of men and 
            women already deprived of their lands, workshops, and communal safety nets."<sup>17</sup>
            The upshot of such policies is that larger segments of the population are now 
            struggling under the burden of massive debt, bankruptcy, unemployment, lack of 
            adequate health care, and a brooding sense of hopelessness. Once again, what is 
            unique about this type of zombie politics is not merely the anti-democratic notion 
            that the market should be the guide for all human actions but also the sheer hatred 
            for any form of sovereignty in which the government could promote the general 
            wel­fare. Zombie politics and the devaluation of the public good go hand in hand.</p>

          <p>As Thom Hartmann points out, zombie politics has given way to punishment 
            as one of the central features of goveming. He describes the policies that flow from 
            such politics as follows: "Government should punish, they agree, but it should 
            never nurture, protect, or defend individuals. Nurturing and protecting, they 
            sug­gest, is the more appropriate role of religious institutions, private charities, 
            families, and-perhaps most important-corporations. Let the corporations handle your 
            old­age pension. Let the corporations decide how much protection we and our 
            environ­ment need from their toxins. Let the corporations decide what we're paid. Let the 
            corporations decide what doctor we can see, when, and for what purpose."<sup>18</sup> But 
            zombie politics and the punishing state do more than substitute charity and private 
            aid for government-backed social provisions while they criminalize a range of 
            existing social problems. They also cultivate a culture of fear and suspicion toward 
            all those other immigrants, refugees, Muslims, youth, minorities of class and color, 
            the unemployed, the disabled, and the elderly-who, in the absence of dense social 
            networks and social supports, fall prey to unprecedented levels of displaced 
            resent­ment from the media, public scorn for their vulnerability, and increased 
            criminal­ization because social protections are considered too costly, thus rendering 
            these groups both dangerous and unfit for integration into American society. Loic 
            Wacquant argues that the rise of the punishing state correlates with the crisis of the 
            welfare state and that welfare agencies and penal policies now work together in 
            offer­ing "relief not to the poor but from the poor, by forcibly 'disappearing' 
            the most dis­ruptive of them, from the shrinking welfare rolls on the one hand and 
            into the swelling dungeons of the carceral castle on the other."<sup>19</sup> Prisons in this 
            view have now become a primary constituent of the neoliberal state. Coupled with this 
            rewrit­ing of the obligations of sovereign-state power and the transfer of sovereignty 
            to the market is a widely endorsed assumption that regardless of the suffering, misery, 
            and problems visited on human beings by these arrangements, they are not only 
            respon­sible for their fate but reliant ultimately on themselves for survival. There 
            is more at stake here than the vengeful return of an older colonial fantasy that 
            regarded the natives as less than human or the now-ubiquitous figure of the 
            disposable worker as a prototypical by-product of the casino capitalist order-though 
            the histories of racist and class-based exclusion inform the withdrawal of moral and 
            ethical con­cerns from these populations.<sup>20</sup> What we are currently witnessing in this 
            form of zombie politics and predatory capitalism is the unleashing of a powerfully 
            regres­sive symbolic and corporeal violence against all those individuals and groups 
            who have been "othered" because their very presence undermines the engines of wealth 
            and inequality that drive the neoliberal dreams of consumption, power, and prof­itability 
            for the very few. While the state still has the power of the law to reduce indi­viduals 
            to impoverishment and to strip them of civil rights, due process, and civil liberties, 
            zombie politics increasingly wields its own form of sovereignty through the invisible 
            hand of the market, which has the power to produce new configurations of control, 
            regulate social health, and alter human life in unforeseen and profound ways. Zygmunt 
            Bauman's analysis of how market sovereignty differs from tradition­al modes of state 
            sovereignty is worth citing in full.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>This strange sovereign [the market] has neither legislative nor executive agencies, not 
          to men­tion courts of law-which are rightly viewed as the indispensable paraphernalia of the 
          bonafide sovereigns explored and described in political science textbooks. ln consequence, 
          the mar­ket is, so to speak, more sovereign than the much advertised and eagerly self-advertising 
          political sovereigns, since in addition to returning the verdicts of exclusion, the market 
          allows for no appeals procedure. Its sentences are as firm and irrevocable as they are informal, 
          tacit, and seldom if ever spelled out in writing. Exemption by the organs of a sovereign state 
          can be objected to and protested against, and so stands a chance of being annulled-but not 
          evic­tion by the sovereign market, because no presiding judge is named here, no receptionist 
          is in sight to accept appeal papers, while no address has been given to which they could be
          mailed.<sup>21</sup></p>

          <p>Traditional modes of liberal politics recognized democracy's dependency on the 
            people it governed and to whom it remained accountable. But no one today votes for 
            which corporations have the right to dominate the media and filter the information
            made available to the public; there is no electoral process that determines how private 
            companies grant or deny people access to adequate health care and other social services. 
            The reign of the market shapes conditions of life and death in a zom­bie economy. It is 
            not restricted to a limited term of appointment, despite the mar­ket's unprecedented 
            sovereignty over the lives of citizens in democratic countries-sovereignty essentially 
            defined as the "power and capacity to dictate who may live and who may die."<sup>22</sup> 
            This shift to market sovereignty, values, and powerpoints to the importance of zombie 
            politics as an attempt to think through not only how politics uses power to mediate the 
            convergence of life and death, but also how sovereign power proliferates those 
            conditions in which individuals marginalized by race, class, and gender configurations 
            are "stripped of political significance and exposed to murderous violence."<sup>23</sup></p>

          <p>Under such circumstances, it is more crucial than ever to develop a politics of 
            resistance that echoes Theodor Adomo's argument that "the undiminished presence 
            of suffering, fear, and menace necessitates that the thought that cannot be realized 
            should not be discarded. [that individuals and citizens] must come to know, with­ 
            out any mitigation, why the world-which could be paradise here and now-can become 
            hell itself tomorrow."<sup>24</sup> If Adomo is right, and I think he is, the task 
            ahead is to fashion a more critical and redemptive notion of politics, one that takes 
            seri­ously the emergence of a form of social death that is becoming the norm rather 
            than the exception for many Americans and at the same time refuses to accept, even 
            in its damaged forms, an apocalyptic zombie politics and its accompanying culture 
            of fear, its endless spectacles of violence that promote airtight forms of domination. 
            We need new political and educational narratives about what is possible in terms 
            of producing a different future, especially for young people, what it means to 
            pro­mote new modes of social responsibility, and what it takes to create sites and 
            strate­gies in which resistance to zombie politics becomes possible. Starting with how we 
            might fight for real economic, institutional, and structural reforms in the interest 
            of children is not without merit for envisioning the broader reforms necessary in an 
            aspiring democracy.</p>

          <p>At the very least, this suggests fighting for a child welfare system that would reduce 
            "family poverty by increasing the minimum wage," institute "a guaranteed income, 
            provide high-quality subsidized child care, preschool education, and paid parental 
            leaves for all families."<sup>25</sup> Young people need a federally funded jobs 
            cre­ation program and wage subsidy that would provide year-round employment for out-of-
            school youth and summer jobs that target in-school, low-income youth. Public and higher 
            education, increasingly defined by corporate and military agen­das, must be reclaimed 
            as democratic public spheres that educate young people about how to govern rather than 
            merely be governed. Incarceration should be the last resort, not the first recourse for 
            dealing with our children. We need to get the police out of public schools, greatly 
            reduce spending for prisons, and hire more teachers, support staff; and community 
            people in order to eliminate the school-to-prison pipeline. In order to make life 
            livable for young people and others, basic supports must be put in place, such as a 
            system of national health insurance that covers every­ body, along with affordable 
            housing. At the very least, we need guaranteed health care for young people, and we 
            need to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare to 55 in order to keep poor families 
            from going bankrupt. And, of course, none of this will take place unless the 
            institutions, power relations, and values that legitimate and reproduce current levels 
            of inequality, power, and human suffering are dismantled. The widening gap between the 
            rich and the poor has to be addressed if young peo­ple are to have a viable future. 
            Ensuring this future for our children will require per­vasive structural reforms that 
            constitute a real shift in both power and politics away from a market-driven system 
            that views too many young people and other vul­nerable populations as disposable. 
            Against a zombie politics and a predatory capi­talism, we need to reimagine what 
            liberty, equality, and freedom might mean as truly democratic values and practices.</p>

          the Culture of<br>
          Deceit in<br>
          Reagan's America</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Lies are often much more plausible, more appealing to reason, than reality, since the 
            liar has the great advantage of knowing beforehand what the audience wishes or expects 
            to hear.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p>
            In the current American political landscape, truth is not merely misrepresented
            or falsified, it is overtly mocked. As is well-known, the Bush administration
            repeatedly lied to the American public, furthering a legacy of government mistrust
            while carrying the practice of distortion to new and almost unimaginable heights.<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>Even now, within 15+ years of Bush's leaving office, it is still difficult to forget the 
            lies and government-sponsored deceits in which it was claimed that Saddam Hussein 
            had weapons of mass destruction, Iraq was making deals with Al-Qaeda, and, per­haps the 
            most infamous of all, the United States did not engage in torture. Unlike 
            many former administrations, the Bush administration was engaged in pure polit­ical 
            theater,<sup>2</sup> giving new meaning to Hannah Arendt's claim that "Truthfulness has 
            never been counted among the political virtues, and lies have always been regard­ed 
            as justifiable tools in political dealings."<sup>3</sup> For instance, when the govemment 
            was­n't lying to promote dangerous policies, it willfully produced and circulated fake 
            news reports in order to provide the illusion that the lies and the policies that flowed 
            from them were supported by selective members of the media and the larger pub­lic. The 
            Bush deceits and lies were almost never challenged by right-wing media 
            "patriots," who were too busy denouncing as un-American anyone who questioned 
            Bush's official stream of deception and deceit. Ironically, some of these pundits were 
            actually on the government payroll for spreading the intellectual equivalent of junk 
            food.</p>

            <p>In such circumstances, language loses any viable sense of referentiality, while 
            lying, misrepresentation, and the deliberate denial of truth become acceptable prac­tices 
            firmly entrenched in the Wild West of talk radio, cable television, and the dom­inant 
            media. Fact-finding, arguments bolstered by evidence, and informed analysis 
            have always been fragile entities, but they risk annihilation in a culture in which it 
            becomes difficult to distinguish between an opinion and an argument. Knowledge 
            is increasingly controlled by a handful of corporations and public relations firms and 
            is systemically cleansed of any complexity. Lying and deceit are all too often 
            viewed as just another acceptable tactic in what has become most visibly the pathol­ogy 
            of politics and a theater of cruelty dominated by a growing chorus of media hate­mongers 
            inflaming an authoritarian populist rage laced with a not-too-subtle bigotry.<sup>4</sup></p>

          <p>Truth increasingly becomes the enemy of democracy because it does not sup­port the 
            spectacle and the reduction of citizens either to mere dupes of power or commodities. 
            Ignorance is no longer a liability in a culture in which lying, deceit, 
            and misinformation blur the boundaries between informed judgments and the 
            histrionics of a shouting individual or mob. Talk radio and television talk show 
            screamers such as Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, and Glenn Beck, in particu­lar, 
            seem to delight in repeating claims that have been discredited in the public arena, 
            demonstrating a barely disguised contempt for both the truth and any viable ves­tige 
            of journalism. These lies and deceits go beyond the classic political gambit, 
            beyond the Watergate-style cover up, beyond the comic "I did not have sex with that 
            woman." The lies and deceptions that are spewed out every day from the right-wing 
            teaching machines-from newspapers and radio shows to broadcast media and the 
            Internet-capitalize on both the mobilizing power of the spectacle, the increasing 
            impatience with reason, and an obsession with what Susan J. Douglas describes as 
            the use of "provocative sound bites over investigative reporting, misinformation over 
            fact."<sup>5</sup> Lying and deception have become so commonplace in the dominant press 
            that such practices appear to have no moral significance and provoke few misgiv­ings, 
            even when they have important political consequences.</p>

          the Culture of<br>
          Deceit in<br>
          Bush I's America, ii</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>In the age of public relations managers and talk show experts, we are witness­ing 
            the demise of public life. At a time when education is reduced to training work­ers and 
            is stripped of any civic ideals and critical practices, it becomes unfashionable 
            for the public to think critically. Rather than intelligence uniting us, a collective 
            igno­rance of politics, culture, the arts, history, and important social issues, as Mark 
            Slouka points out, "gives us a sense of community it confers citizenship."<sup>6</sup> Our political pas­sivity is underscored by a paucity of intellectual engagemcnt,just as the need for 
            dis­crete judgment and informed analysis falls prey to a culture of watching, a culture 
            of illusion and circus tricks. Shame over the lying and ignorance that now shape our 
            cultural politics has become a source of national pride-witness the pathetic 
            response to ]oe Wilson's outburst against President Obama. Or, for that matter, the 
            celebrated and populist response to Sarah Pa1in's lies about death panels, which are 
            seized upon not because they distort the truth and reveal the dishonesty and vile­ness 
            of political opportunism-while also unsuccessfully attempting to undermine 
            a viable health care bill-but because they tap into a sea of growing anger and 
            hyped-up ignorance and ratchet up poll ratings. Lying and deceit have become the 
            stuff of spectacle and are on full display in a society where gossip and celebrity cul­ture 
            rule. In this instance, the consequences of lying are reduced to a matter of pruri­ence 
            rather than public concern, becoming a source of private injury on the part of 
            a Hollywood star or producing the individual humiliation of a public figure such 
            as John Edwards.</p>

          <p>The widespread acceptance of lying and deceit is not merely suggestive of a 
            commodified and ubiquitous corporate-driven electronic culture that displays an 
            utter contempt for morality and social needs: it also registers the existence of a 
            trou­bling form of infantilization and depoliticization. Lying as common sense and 
            deceit as politics-as-usual join the embrace of provocation in a coupling that emp­ties 
            politics and agency of any substance and feeds into a corporate state and mil­itarized 
            culture in which matters of judgment, thoughtfulness, morality, and compassion seem 
            to disappear from public view. What is the social cost of such flight 
            from reality, if not the death of democratic politics, critical thought, and civic 
            agency? When a society loses sight of the distinction between fact and fiction, truth­ 
            telling and lying, what happens is that truth, critical thought, and fact-finding as 
            conditions of democracy are rendered trivial and reduced to a collection of mere 
            plat­itudes, which in turn reinforces moral indifference and political impotence. Under 
            such circumstances, language actually becomes the mechanism for promoting polit­ical 
            powerlessness. Lying and deceit are no longer limited to merely substituting 
            falsehoods for the truth; they now performatively constitute their own truth, pro­moting 
            celebrity culture, right-wing paranoia, and modes of government and cor­porate power 
            freed from any sense of accountability.</p>

          <p>While all governments resort to misrepresentations and lies, we appear to have 
            entered a brave new world in which lies, distortions, and exaggerations have become 
            so commonplace that when something is said by a politician, it is often meant to 
            suggest its opposite, and without either irony or apology As lies and deceit become 
            a matter of policy, language loses its grip on reality, and the resulting indetermina­cy 
            of meaning is often used by politicians and others to embrace positions that 
            change from one moment to the next. Witness Dick Cheney, who once referred to 
            torture as "enhanced interrogation" so as to sugarcoat its brutality and then appeared 
            on national television in 2009 only to defend torture by arguing that if such prac­
            tices work, they are perfectly justified, even if they violate the law. This is the same
            Cheney who, appearing on the May 31, 2005, Larry King Live show, attempted to
            repudiate charges of government torture by claiming, without irony, that the
            detainees "have been well treated, treated humanely and decently."This type of dis­
            course recalls George Orwel1's dystopian world of 1984 in which the Ministry of
            Truth produces lies and the Ministry of Love tortures people. Remember when the
            Bush administration used the "Healthy Forest Initiative" to give loggers access to
            protected wilderness areas or the "Clear Skies Initiative" to enable greater industri­
            al air pollution? Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, appearing on ABC's
            Good MomingAmerica in January 2010, embraced one of the most sordid lies of the
            year with his claim that "We had no domestic attacks under Bush," as if the attacks
            on 9/11 never happened. Of course, there is a certain irony here given that he never
            stopped referring to 9/11 as a way to shamelessly mobilize support for his own failed
            presidential bid. President Obama also indulges in this kind of semantic dishon­
            esty when he substitutes "prolonged detention" for the much-maligned "preventive
            detention" policies he inherited from the Bush-Cheney regime. While Obama is not
            Bush, the use of this type of duplicitous language calls to mind the Orwellian night­mare
            in which "war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength."</p>

          <p>When lying and deceit become normalized in a culture, they serve as an index
            of how low we have fallen as a literate and civilized society. Such practices also
            demonstrate the degree to which language and education have become corrupted,
            tied to corporate and political power, and sabotaged by rigid ideologies as part of a
            growing authoritarianism that uses the educational force of the culture, the means
            of communication, and the sites in which information circulate to mobilize igno­
            rance among a misinformcd citizenry, all the while supporting reactionary policies.
            Especially since the horrible events of September 11, 2001, Americans have been
            encouraged to identify with a militaristic way of life, to suspend their ability to read
            the word and world critically, to treat corporate and government power in almost
            religious terms, and to view a culture of questioning as something alien and poiso­nous 
            to American society. Shared fears rather than shared responsibilities now
            mobilize angry mobs and gun-toting imbeciles who are praised as "real" Americans.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">The Politics of Lying and<br>
          the Culture of<br>
          Deceit in<br>
          Bush II's America, iii</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Fear bolstered by lies and manufactured deceptions makes us immune to even the 
            most obvious moral indecencies, such as the use of taser guns on kids in schools. 
            Nobody notices or cares, and one cause and casualty of all of this moral indiffer­ence 
            is that language has been emptied of its critical content just as the public spaces 
            that make it possible are disappearing into the ??anns of corporations, advertisers, and 
            other powerful institutions that show nothing but contempt for either the public 
            sphere or the kind of critical literacy that gives it meaning.</p>

          <p>Obama's presence on the national political scene gave literacy, language, and 
            critical thought a newfound sense of dignity, interlaced as they were with a vision 
            of hope, justice, and possibility-and reasonable arguments about the varied crises 
            America faced. But as Obama compromised, if not surrendered, some of his prin­ciples  
            to those individuals and groups that live in the language of duplicity, the 
            ide­alism that shaped his vocabulary began to look like just another falsehood when 
            measured against his continuation of a number of Bush-like policies. In this case, 
            the politics of distortion and misrepresentation that Obama's lack of integrity has 
            produced may prove to be even more dangerous than what we got under Bush, 
            because it wraps itself in a moralism that seems uplifting and hopeful while supporting ­
            policies that reward the rich, reduce schools to testing centers, and contin­ue 
            to waste lives and money on wars that should have ended when Obama assumed 
            his presidency. Obama claims he is for peace, and yet the United States is the largest 
            arms dealer in the world. He claims he wants to reduce the deficit but instead spends 
            billions on the defense industry and wars abroad. He says he wants everyone to have 
            access to decent health care but makes backroom deals with powerful pharmaceu­tical 
            companies. Orwell's ghost haunts this new president and the country at large.</p>

          <p>Reducing the critical power of language has been crucial to this effort. Under such
            circumstances, democracy as either a moral referent or a political ideal appears to
            have lost any measure of credibility. The politics of lying and the culture of deceit
            are inextricably related to a theater of cruelty and modes of corrupt power in which
            politics is reduced to a ritualized incantation, just as matters of governance are
            removed from real struggles over meaning and power.</p>

          <p>Beyond disinformation and disguise, the politics of lying and the culture of 
            deceit trade in and abet the rhetoric of fear in order to manipulate the public into 
            a state of servile political dependency and unquestioning ideological support. Fear 
            (and its attendant use of moral panics) not only creates a rhetorical umbrella to 
            pro­mote right-wing ideological agendas (increased military spending, tax relief for the 
            rich, privatization, market-driven reforms, and religious intolerance) but also 
            con­tributes to a sense of helplessness and cynicism throughout the body politic. The 
            collapse of any vestige of critical literacy, reason, and sustained debate gives way to 
            falsehoods and forms of ignorance that find expression in the often-racist 
            dis­course of what Bob Herbert calls "the moronic maestros of right wing radio and
            endlessly haranguing the public to resist any trace of reason. How else to 
            explain the actions of parents who refiise to let their children listen to a speech on 
            education by should I say it, an African American president? How else to fathom 
            the dominant media repeating uncritically the views of right-wing groups that 
            portray Obama as Hitler or Stalin or consistently making references that compare 
            him to a gorilla or indulge in other crude racist references? In recent days, these 
            groups have been given ample media attention, as if their opinions are not simply 
            ventriloquizing the worst species of ignorance and racism.</p>

          <p>The politics of lying and the culture of deceit are wrapped in the logic of
            absolute certainty, an ominous harbinger of a kind of illiteracy in which one no
            longer has to be accountable for justifying opinions, claims, or alleged arguments.
            Stripped of accountability, language finds its final resting place in a culture of
            deceit and arrogance in which lying either is accepted as a political strategy or is
            viewed as simply another normalized aspect of everyday life. The lack of criticism
            surrounding both government practices and corporations that now exercise unpar­alleled 
            forms of power is more than shameful; it is an utter capitulation to an 
            Orwellian rhetoric that only thinly veils an egregious form of authoritarianism and
            racism. In the face of such events, we muSt develop a critical discourse to address 
            the gap between rhetoric and deeds of those who hold economic, political, and social 
            power. As Hannah Arendt has argued, debate is central to a democratic politics, 
            along with the public space in which individuals can argue, exercise critical judg­ment, 
            and clarify their relationship to democratic values and public commitments. Critical 
            consciousness and autonomy are, after all, not merely the stuff of political 
            awareness but what makes democratic accountability possible in the first place. They 
            are also the foundation and precondition for individuals, parents, community 
            groups, and social movements to mobilize against such political and moral corrup­tions.</p>

          the Culture of<br>
          Deceit in<br>
          Trump's America, iv</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Democracy is fragile and its fate is always uncertain, but during the last 
            decade we have witnessed those in commanding political and corporate positions exhibit
            an utter disregard for the truth, morality, and critical debate. The Enron template
            of lying and deception has turned an ethos of dialogue and persuasion into its oppo­site: 
            dogmatism and propaganda. In doing so, the American public has been bom­barded by a 
            discourse of fear, hate, and racism, coupled with a politics of lying that 
            undermines any viable vestige of a democratic ethos. We now find ourselves living 
            in a society in which right-wing extremists not only wage a war against the truth 
            but also seek to render human beings less than fully human by taking away their 
            desire for justice, spiritual meaning, freedom, and individuality.</p>

          <p>Politics must become more attentive to those everyday conditions that have 
            allowed the American public to remain complicitous with such barbaric policies and 
            practices. Exposing the underlying conditions and symptoms of a culture of lying 
            and deceit is both a political and a pedagogical task that demands that people speak 
            out and break through the haze of oflicial discourse, media-induced amnesia, and 
            the fear-producing lies of corrupt politicians and the swelling ranks of 
            hatemon­gers. The politics of lying and deceit at the current historical moment offers 
            up the specter of notjust government abuse, mob hysteria, and potential violence, 
            but also an incipient authoritarianism, one that avidly seeks to eliminate intelligent 
            delib­eration, informed public discussion, engaged criticism, and the very possibility of 
            freedom and a vital democratic politics. The spirit of critique is meaningless with­ 
            out literacy and an informed public. For such a public to flourish, it must be 
            sup­ported with public debate and informed agents capable of becoming both witness­es 
            to injustice and forces for transforming those political, economic, and institutional 
            conditions that impose silence and perpetuate human suffering. The distortions, 
            misrepresentations, and lies that have become an integral part of American culture 
            present a serious threat to an aspiring democracy, because they further what John 
            Dewey called the "eclipse of the public," just as they empty politics of its democratic 
            values, meanings, and possibilities.</p>

          <p>The hate, extremism, and pathology that have come to define our national polit­ical 
            and popular landscapes-heard repeatedly in the prattle of Sarah Palin and 
            Glenn Beck, to name only two of the most popular examples-are legitimated by 
            an appeal to absolute certainty, which becomes the backdrop against which a pol­itics 
            of lying and a culture of deceit, fear, cruelty and repression flourish. We are 
            wit­nessing in the politics of lying and the culture of deceit a disconnection between 
            language and social responsibility, politics and critical education, market interests 
            and democratic values, privately felt pain and joys and larger public considerations.</p>

          <p>Under such circumstances morality becomes painless, if not invisible, while social 
            responsibility is erased from the vocabulary of mainstream politics and the domi­nant 
            cultural apparatus. And this undermining of the value of human dignity, 
            truth, dialogue, and critical thought is the offspring of a debate over much more than  
            simply meaning and language, or even the widespread legitimacy of individual and 
            institutional ignorance and corruption. At its core it is a debate about power and 
            those corporate and political interests that create the conditions in which lying 
            becomes acceptable and deceit commonplace-those forces that have the power to 
            frame in increasingly narrow ways the conventions, norms, language, and relations 
            through which we relate to ourselves and others.</p>

          <p>How we define ourselves as a nation cannot be separated from the language we 
            value, inhabit, and use to shape our understanding of others and the world in 
            which we want to live. As the language of critique, civic responsibility; political 
            courage, and democracy disappears along with sustained investments in schools, 
            media, and other elements of a formative culture that keeps an aspiring democra­cy 
            alive, we lose the spaces and capacities to imagine a future in which language, 
            literacy, and hope are on the side of justice, rather than on the side of hate, willful 
            ignorance, and widespread injustice.</p>

          <p>In a robust democratic society, language and critical thought have a liberating 
            function. At best, they work together to shatter illusions, strengthen the power 
            of reason and critical judgment, and provide the codes and framing mechanisms for 
            human beings to exercise a degree of self-determination while holding the throne 
            of governmental, military, and economic power accountable. Language in such a 
            society is engaged, critical, dialectical, historical, and creates the conditions for 
            dia­logue, thoughtfinlness, and informed action. Such a language refuses to be 
            co­opted in the service of marketing goods, personalities, and sleazy corporations.</p>

          <p>Needless to say, it is a language that is troubling and almost always threatening to 
            the guardians of the status quo. As Toni Morrison points out in another context, 
            language that is troubling has a way of reading and writing the world, that "can 
            dis­turb the social oppression that functions like a coma on the population, a coma
            despots call peace. . .[that makes visible] the blood flow of war that hawks and 
            prof­iteers thrill to."<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>In authoritarian societies, language works to produce forms of historical and 
            social amnesia, using the media, universities, and other sites of public pedagogy to
            cover the visual landscape with a coma-inducing ignorance. This political and
            moral coma allows the living dead to further experiment with those political 
            mech­anisms and social filters employed to freeze meaning, limit the discourses of 
            free­dom, and make certain ideas unspeakable, if not unthinkable. Tales of repression,
            cruelty, human suffering, and evil disappear from public memory, becoming 
            invis­ible as politics works through a zombie-like language to make unjust and 
            repres­sive power invisible. This type of coma-like amnesia seems to have become one of 
            the defining features of the new American century. At the same time this language 
            and the ideologies and modes of goveming are always conditional, open to resis­tance, 
            and capable of being challenged by new modes of discourse, understanding, and courage. 
            One example can be seen in the ongoing resistance emerging in Iran against the 
            state's use of power to extend its ever-increasing restrictions on the new 
            media and lntemet to curb the power of the living and vital language of dissent. It 
            can also be seen in the rewriting of history textbooks by right-wing extremists who
            control the Texas State Board of Education. In their attempt to whitewash histo­ry 
            they have replaced the word capitalism with free-enterprise system, rejected the 
            separation of church and state as a constitutional principle, injected the importance 
            of what they call biblical and pro-Confederate values, and replaced references to the 
            slave trade with the more innocuous "Atlantic triangular trade," and redefined the
            Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a struggle driven by Islamic fundamentalism.<sup>2</sup></p>

          <p>Language that is coma producing always serves the interests of the living dead, 
            becoming zombie-like in its ability to sap the meaning of any political and ethical 
            substance. Such a language is suffocating, Orwellian in its hypocrisy and death-deal­ing 
            and cruel in the relationships it often produces and legitimates. For instance, 
            as Michael Moore points out in his film Capitalismsd Love Story, a number of 
            blue­chip companies take out insurance policies on their employees without telling 
            them. Not only do such policies offer tax breaks for the rich, they also provide very 
            lucrative sums of money for corporations when an employee dies. Irma Johnson 
            found this out the hard way after her husband, Daniel, died of brain cancer. She dis­
            covered that the bank that had fired him received close to $4.5 million dollars in
            insurance proceeds.<sup>3</sup> She got nothing. The corporations refer to these lucrative and
            cruel schemes as "dead peasant policies." This is a discourse in which the living dead
            literally benefit from the deaths of their fired employees-zombie politics at its most
            transparent and morally repulsive.</p>

          <p>At its best, language can invite us to think beyond the given and the realm of
            common sense, becoming a poweriiil force for unleashing the power of insight,
            imagination, and possibility. Yet we live at a time when language is often deployed
            by those with social, political, and economic resources that narrow its horizons, close
            down its appeal to truth claims, and empty content of any viable substance. When
            employed by those corrupted by power, language is often stripped of elements of
            critique, thoughtfiilness, and compassion. Such a language cheapens public values,
            the notion of the common good, and increasingly appropriates all potential spaces
            for a viable politics through a debased appeal to self-interest, personal fears, money,
            and national security.</p>

          <p>If successful, the language of oppression and cruelty becomes normalized,
            removed from the sphere of criticism and the culture of questioning. Such a lan­guage 
            does more than normalize ignorance, illiteracy, and irrationality; it also pro­duces 
            a kind of psychic hardening and deep-rooted pathology in a society increasingly willing 
            to eliminate the policies that enable the social bonds and pro­tections necessary for a 
            substantive democracy. This language of cruelty, a zombie­ inspired discourse of sorts, 
            has been given a new life within the last few decades as it has become the Iinguafianca 
            of powerful American politicians, corporations, and many in the dominant media. And it is 
            mobilized to both dismantle the liberating function of critical reason and to stifle 
            criticisms ofa society that appears to be adrift. Such a discourse turns hate-talk into 
            a commodity and human suffering into a spec­tacle.</p>

          <p>Rarely do we find a robust language at workin the corporate-mediated public 
            domains that provides a sustained criticism of an imperial presidency, an econom­ic 
            system removed from all political and ethical constraints, a debased and debas­ing 
            celebrity culture, a market-driven notion of consumerism that strips people of 
            any other vestige of agency, an utter disregard for the lawlessness and inequality 
            caused by casino capitalism, a permanent war economy and a discourse of contempt 
            aimed at those marginalized by poverty and race in America. While there are 
            cer­tainly criticisms of such practices and policies at work in American societyg they are 
            either marginalized, trivialized, or simply treated with disdain and viewed as 
            irrel­evant by those in power.</p>

          <p>Flashpoints in a culture often signal the rise of this language of cruelty, suggest­ing 
            ruptures in the democratic fabric of a country that speak to something forebod­ing in its 
            present and future that is not merely disturbing but portends a new kind of evil, a 
            gathering storm capable of ushering in a new kind of authoritarianism. Hurricane Katrina, 
            declarations supporting torture by elected officials, bailouts for the rich and 
            indifference for the poor, and millions of people sleeping on the street or in tents 
            signal something new and despairing about American society. The story continues. For 
            instance, in ]une 2005, Vice President Dick Cheney, in response to revelations of 
            torture at Guantanamo, claimed that the prisoners in the detention camp inhabited 
            something similar to Club Med. According to Cheney "They're liv­ing in the tropics. 
            They're well fed. 'l`hey've got everything they could possibly want."<sup>4</sup></p>

          <p>What is most scandalous about this remark is not the sheer duplicity of the 
            mis­representation, or even the trivialization of human rights violations, but the attempt
            to silence or make disappear an ever-expanding narrative of extreme cruelty and pain
            inflicted on the bodies of those who have been forced to inhabit, without any legal
            rights, what would be more aptly called Club Torture. We know from a number of
            reports and from the leaked images of Abu Ghraib prison that combatants in var­ious U.S. 
            detention centers have been subjected to the most horrendous forms of torture, often 
            severely injured and left to suffer with irreparable mental anguish. In other instances 
            of torture and abuse, detainees "have been murdered."<sup>5</sup> But there is more at work in 
            Cheney's comments than fabrications designed to promote certain convenient ideological 
            illusions central to the new world order promoted by the Bush administration. There is 
            also a hidden order of politics that suggests a certain psychic hardening of the 
            culture, the triumph of a debased language and politics over any semblance of ethics 
            and civic courage-clearly reinforced by the loss of a crit­ical media, schools that 
            actually teach young people to think critically, and those public spheres where 
            viable public analyses can take place. This is a new register and expression of 
            cruelty for the American empire because it now defines itself unapolo­getically and 
            with great arrogance through its exercise of what could be appropri­ately called 
            radical evil.</p>

          <p>Evidence of this type of psychic hardening and moral depravity extends far 
            beyond the more recently revealed torture memos, the media's embrace of Sarah 
            Palin's talk about death panels, the gleeful expressions of racism that are back in 
            fash­ion, the rise of hate-radio, and the triumphalist justifications for imperial power that 
            file the language of the likes of Dick Cheney Michael Savage, and Fox News. Even 
            after President Obama condemned torture and made it illegal once again, those 
            politicians and lawyers who supported torture and played a prominent role in both 
            legitimating it and sanctioning it under the Bush administration refused to exhib­it 
            the slightest bit of self-reflection or remorse over their support for a state that 
            tor­tures. For instance, in a revealing interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York 
            Times at the end of November 2009, James Inhofe, a conservative Republican 
            Senator from Oklahoma, stated that he did not think that the naval base at 
            Guantanamo should be closed because it was "a real resource."<sup>6</sup> Inhofe then talked 
            about Gitmo-this Gulag for the stateless roundly condemned all over the world­ 
            as if it were a vacation spot generously provided by the U.S. government for 
            detainees, many of whom were legally but unjustly rendered as part of America's war 
            on terror. What is even more astounding is that Inhofe seemed completely unwill­ing 
            to entertain the overwhelming and substantial body of evidence now available 
            as a matter of public record that proves that many of the detainees at Guantanamo 
            were subjected by the American government to sexual abuse, human rights viola­ 
            tions, and the systemic practice of torture. He states, without any irony intended:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The people there are treated probably better than they are in the prisons in America. They 
            have more doctors and medical practitioners per inmate.They're eating better than anyone 
            has ever eaten before .... One of the big problems is they become obese when they get there 
            because they've never eaten that good before.<sup>7</sup></p>

          <p>There is more than denial and ignorance at work in Inhofe's answer. It is also 
            symp­tomatic of a society that is no longer capable of questioning itself, unraveling its 
            abil­ity to think critically and act in a morally responsible way This is a society in which 
            language has become so debased and corrupted by power that morality and truth 
            claims are no longer open to examination, and the consequences spell catastrophe 
            for democracy. ln another interview, Solomon asked ]ohn Yoo, the former Justice 
            Department lawyer and one of the architects of the torture memos, if he regretted 
            writing the memos, which offered President Bush a legal rationale for ignoring 
            domestic and international laws prohibiting torture.<sup>8</sup> Exhibiting a complete 
            indif­ference to the moral issue at stake in justifying systemic torture, Yoo provided 
            an answer not unlike those provided by Nazi war criminals prosecuted at the 
            Nuremberg military tribunals in 1945. I-Ie stated: "No, I had to write them. It was
            my job. As a lawyer, I had a client. The client needed a legal question answered."<sup>9</sup></p>

          <p>More recently, it was widely reported in the dominant media that there are over 
            39 million people on food stamps, and 6 million of these people have no other source 
            of income. Put another way, "About one in 50 Americans now lives in a household 
            with a reported income that consists of nothing but a food-stamp card."<sup>l0</sup> These 
            figures become all the more tragic when we learn that one in four children are on 
            food stamps. Surely such a story should move the American public to both ques­tion 
            any society with this degree of inequality and move in some transformative way
            to address the needless suffering of millions of people. When the story was report­ed 
            in T/Je New York Times, it was largely descriptive, the language used was blood­less, 
            sterile, lacking any sense of either urgency or suggesting the need for political 
            action on the part of the American public. The one criticism in the article came from 
            John Linder, a Georgia Republican and a ranking member of the House Panel on 
            Welfare Policy Displaying what can truly be called a zombie politics and language 
            only fit for persuading the living dead, he criticized the food stamp program, 
            argu­ing that "We're at risk of creating an entire class of people, a subset of people, 
            just comfortable getting by living off the government."<sup>11</sup> Linder's use of language 
            mim­ics the moral depravity we find in the words of hot-shot investment bankers who 
            hand out billions in bonuses while millions are starving because of the financial 
            mar­kets' recklessness. For the bankers, bonuses are-as one CEO put it-a form of 
            God's work. There is more at play here than ignorance; there is also a deep sense 
            of scorn for any viable notion of the welfare state and the necessity of government 
            to address in a profound way the needless suffering of those caught in the expand­ing 
            network of systemic inequality, unemployment, and poverty.</p>

          <p>This use of dead language, stripped of insight, ethics, and compassion, has now 
            become commonplace in America and suggests that we have become a country with 
            no interest in modes of governance that extend beyond the narrow and often ruth­less 
            interests of investment bankers, mega-corporations, the ultra-rich, the Department 
            of Defense, and casino capitalism. Linguistic appeals to present-day zombies 
            erase any viable notion of the social, public sphere, and the common good. 
            Rather than talk about the responsibilities of the welfare state and social safety 
            nets for the millions of Americans in need, government and corporate spokespersons 
            employ a language of bare life-devoid of compassion and respect for the other. This 
            is a language that erases the social and all of the human bonds and conditions 
            nec­essary to provide human relationships with joy, dignity, hope, justice, and a 
            measure of moral and social responsibility. The realm of the social, the glue of 
            public life and the common good, has been utterly privatized within this 
            death-inspired language and cut off from the political, economic, and moral 
            connections that give society any viable identity and meaning. As the language 
            of war, finance, and markets dri­ves politics, matters of ethics, social 
            responsibility, thinking from the place of the other, and addressing the 
            conditions under which it becomes possible to apprehend the suffering of 
            others becomes not only difficult but is more often than not treat­ed with 
            contempt.</p>

          <p>Zombie language, with its appeal to the living dead, erases the social as it 
            pri­vatizes it and can only imagine freedom through the narrow lens of self-interest, 
            exchange values, and profit margins. Troubles are now privatized, resulting in "yet 
            more loneliness and impotence, and indeed more uncertainty still."<sup>12</sup> Society in this 
            view is a network of random connections and disconnections, tied to furthering the 
            interests of competitive individuals and fueled by a rabid individualism. Zombie 
            lan­guage is more than Orwellian in that it does not merely offer up illusions, it 
            arro­gantly celebrates those values, structures, institutions and modes of power 
            that are on the side of death, the perpetuation of human suffering, and a 
            world-view that cannot think beyond the maximizing pleasures of grotesque power, 
            wealth, and priv­ilege.</p>

          <p>Cheney, Inhofe, Yoo, the heads of the commanding financial institutions, and 
            too many others to name exhibit and legitimize the type of zombie language along 
            with an unethical mode of behavior that is chilling in its moral transgressions and 
            telling in its reflection of the political and moral corruption that has taken hold of 
            American culture. But the cruelties and crimes that these individuals, corporations, 
            and administrations produce as official policy through a language of the living 
            dead could not have taken place if there were not a formative culture in place in the 
            United States that in its silence and complicity supported and enabled such a 
            dis­course and its accompanying acts of barbarism and cruelty Within such a culture, 
            as Judith Butler reminds us, it becomes increasingly easy for human life to be 
            sac­rificed to an instrumental logic, a totalitarian view of authority, and a 
            discourse of fear. Such a culture loses its moral compass, sanctions cruel polices 
            that produce mas­sive human suffering and disposability, and in the end becomes unable 
            to entertain those norms or shared conditions that make human life possible, that 
            apprehend the dignity of human life or offer the political and moral frameworks 
            "to guard against injury and violence."<sup>13</sup> Under such circumstances, individual 
            rights, protections, and civil liberties disappear as the most barbaric 
            state-sanctioned practices are carried out with only minor opposition registered 
            by the American people. Zombie lan­guage and its accompanying practices and policies 
            are nourished by the egocentric politics ofa rabid individualism, the punishing 
            values of casino capitalism, and the harsh logic of privatization in which all 
            problems are now shifted onto the shoul­ders of individuals, who have to bear the 
            ?? burden of solving them. The culture of cruelty that emerges in this 
            market-driven ideology and the language that legit­imates it points not merely to 
            the death of public values or to a society that is polit­ically adrift, but more 
            importantly to the unleashing of institutions, ideas, values, and social relations 
            that may lead to the demise of democracy itself.</p>

          and<br>
          the Culture of<br>
          Cruelty</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Under the Bush administration, a seeping, sometimes galloping authoritarian­ism 
            began to reach into every vestige of the culture, giving free rein to those
            anti-democratic forces in which religious, market, military and political 
            fundamen­talism thrived, casting an ominous shadow over the fate of U.S. 
            democracy. During the Bush-Cheney regime, power became an instrument of 
            retribution connected to and fuelled by a repressive state, a kind of zombie 
            state trading in human abuse, fear, and punishment! A bullying rhetoric of war, 
            a ruthless consolidation of eco­nomic forces, and an all-embracing, free-market 
            apparatus and media-driven ped­agogy of fear supported and sustained a distinct 
            culture of cruelty and inequality in the United States.</p>

          <p>In pointing to a culture of cruelty, I am not employing a form of leftist 
            moral­ism that collapses matters of power and politics into the discourse of 
            character. On the contrary, I think the notion of a culture of cruelty is useful 
            in thinking through the convergence of everyday life and politics, of considering 
            material relations of power-the disciplining of the body as an object of control-on 
            the one hand, and the production of cultural meaning, especially the co-optation 
            of popular culture to sanction oliicial violence, on the other. The culture of 
            cruelty is important for thinking through how life and death now converge in 
            ways that fundamentally transform how we understand and imagine politics in the 
            current historical moment-a moment when the most vital elements of the social 
            safety net are being undermined by right-wing ideologues. What is it about a 
            culture of cruelty that pro­vides the conditions for many Americans to believe 
            that government is the enemy of health care reform and health care reform should 
            be tumed over to corporate and market-driven interests, further depriving millions 
            of an essential right? And while a weak version of the health care bill has passed, 
            the living undead are vowing to undo the bill through upcoming elections.<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>Increasingly, many individuals and groups now find themselves living in a 
            society that measures the worth of human life in terms of cost-benefit analyses. The 
            central issue of life and politics is no longer about working to get ahead but strug­gling 
            simply to survive. And many groups considered marginal because they are poor, 
            unemployed, people of color, elderly, or young, have not just been excluded from "the
            American dream" but have become utterly redundant and disposable, waste prod­ucts of a 
            society that no longer considers them of any value.<sup>2</sup> How else to explain 
            the zealousness with which social safety nets have been dismantled, the transition 
            from welfare to workfare (offering little job training programs and no child care), 
            and the now infamous acrimony over health care reform's failed public option? What 
            accounts for the passage of laws that criminalize the conduct of millions of home­less 
            people in the United States, often defining sleeping, sitting, soliciting, lying 
            down, or loitering in public places as a criminal offense rather than a behavior in 
            need of compassionate good will and public assistance? Or, for that matter, the 
            expulsions, suspensions, segregation, class discrimination, and racism in the public 
            schools as well as the more severe beatings, broken bones, and damaged lives 
            endured by young people in the juvenile justice system?</p>

          <p>Within this type of zombie politics, largely filelled by a market fundamental­ism-
            one that substitutes the power of the social state with the power of the cor­porate 
            state and only values wealth, money, and consumers-there is a ruthless and 
            hidden dimension of cruelty, one in which the powers of life and death are increas­ingly 
            determined by punishing apparatuses, such as the criminal justice system for 
            poor people of color and/ or market forces that increasingly decide who may live and 
            who may die.</p>

          <p>The growing dominance of right-wing media forged in a pedagogy of hate has 
            become a crucial element providing numerous platforms for a culture of cruelty and 
            is fimdamental to how we understand the role of education in a range of sites 
            out­side of traditional forms of schooling. This educational apparatus and mode of 
            pub­lic pedagogy are central to analyzing not just how power is exercised, rewarded, 
            and contested in a growing culture of cruelty, but also how particular identities, 
            desires, and needs are mobilized in support of an overt racism, hostility toward 
            immi­grants, and Utter disdain coupled with the threat of mob violence toward any 
            polit­ical figure supportive of the social contract and the welfare state. Citizens 
            are increasingly constructed through a language of contempt for all non-commercial 
            public spheres and a chilling indifference to the plight of others that is 
            increasing­ly expressed in vicious tirades against big government and almost any 
            form of social protection, however necessary There is a growing element of scom 
            on the part of the American public for those human beings caught in a web of 
            misfortune, human suffering, dependency, and deprivation. As Barbara Ehrenreich 
            observes, "The pattem is to curtail fmancing for services that might help the 
            poor while ramp­ing up law enforcement: starve school and public transportation 
            budgets, then make truancy illegal. Shut down public housing, then make it a 
            crime to be homeless. Be sure to harass street vendors when there are few 
            other opportunities for employment. The experience of the poor, and especially 
            poor minorities, comes to resemble that of a rat in a cage scrambling to avoid 
            erratically administered elec­tric shocks."<sup>3</sup></p>

          <p>A right-wing spin machine, influenced by haters like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn 
            Beck, Michael Savage, and Ann Coulter endlessly spews out a toxic rhetoric in 
            which all Muslims are defined as jihadists; the homeless are not victims of 
            misfor­tune but lazy; blacks are not terrorized by a racist criminal justice 
            system but are the main architects of a culture of criminality; the epidemic 
            of obesity has nothing to do with corporations, big agriculture, and advertisers 
            selling junk food but rather the result of "big" govemment giving people food 
            stamps; the public sphere is largely for white people, and it is being threatened 
            by immigrants and people of color, and so it goes. Glenn Beck, the alleged voice 
            of the common man, appear­ing on the Fox fs' Friends morning show, calls President 
            Obama a "racist" and accuses him of "having a deep-seated hatred for white people 
            or the white culture."<sup>4</sup></p>

          <p>Nationally syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh unapologetically states that James 
            Earl Ray, the confessed killer of Martin Luther King, ]r., should be given a 
            posthu­mous Medal of Honor,<sup>5</sup> while his counterpart in right-wing hate, talk radio 
            host Michael Savage, states on his show, "You know, when I see a woman walking 
            around with a burqa, I see a Nazi. That's what I sewhow do you like that?-a hate­ful 
            Nazi who would like to cut your throat and kill your children."<sup>6</sup> He also claims 
            that Obama is "surrounded by terrorists" and is "raping America." This is a 
            varia­tion of a crude theme established by Ann Coulter, who refers to Bill Clinton 
            as a "very good rapist."<sup>7</sup> Even worse, Obama is a "neo-Marxist fascist dictator in 
            the making" who plans to "force children into a paramilitary domestic army"<sup>8</sup> And 
            this is just a small sampling of the kind of hate talk that permeates right-wing 
            media.</p>

          <p>This could be dismissed as loony right-wing political theater if it were not for the
            low levels of civic literacy displayed by so many Americans who choose to believe 
            and invest in this type of hate talk.<sup>9</sup> On the contrary while it may be idiocy it reveals, 
            as I state throughout this book, a powerful set of political, economic, and education­al 
            forces at work in miseducating the American public while at the same time 
            extending the culture of cruelty and the politics of the hyper-dead. One central task 
            of any viable form of politics is to analyze the culture of cruelty and its overt and 
            covert dimensions of violence, often parading as entertainment.</p>

          <p>Underlying the culture of cruelty that reached its apogee during the Bush 
            administration was the legalization of state violence, such that human suffering was 
            now sanctioned by the law, which no longer served as a summons to justice. But if 
            a legal culture emerged that made violence and human suffering socially acceptable, 
            popular culture rendered such violence pleasurable by commodifying, aestheticiz­ing, 
            and spectacularizing it. Rather than being unspoken and unseen, violence in 
            American life had become both visible in its pervasiveness and normalized as a cen­tral 
            feature of dominant and popular culture. Americans had grown accustomed to 
            luxuriating in a warm bath of cinematic blood, as young people and adults alike were 
            seduced with commercial and military video games such as Grand They? Auto and 
            AmericaArmy,<sup>10</sup> the television series 24 and its ongoing Bacchanalian féte of 
            tor­ture, the cmde violence on display in World Wrestling Entertainment and Ultimate 
            Fighting Championship, and an endless series of vigilante films such as The Brave 
            One (2007), Death Sentence (2007), and Harry Bro-wn (2010), in which the rule of 
            law is suspended by the viscerally satisfying images of men and women seeking 
            revenge as laudable killing machines--a nod to the permanent state of emergency
            and war in the United States. Symptomatically, there is the mindless glorification 
            and aestheticization of brutal violence in the most celebrated Hollywood films, 
            including many of Oyentin Tarantino's films, especially Deatb Proqf (2007), Kill Bill
            I C9' 2 (2003, 2004), and Inglourious Bastards (2009). With the release of Tarantino's 
            2009 bloody war film, in fact, the press reported that Dianne Kruger, the co-star of 
            Inglourious Basterds, claimed that she "loved being tortured by Brad Pitt [though] 
            she was frustrated she didn't get an opportunity to get frislcy with her co-star, but 
            admits being beaten by Pitt was a satisfying experience."<sup>11</sup> This is more than the
            aestheticization of violence; it is the normalization and glorification of torture
            itself.</p>

          <p>If Hollywood has made gratuitous violence the main staple of its endless 
            parade of blockbuster films, television has tapped into the culture of cruelty in a way 
            that was unimaginable before the attack on the United States on September 11, 
            2001. Prime-time television before the attacks had "fewer than four acts of torture" 
            per year, but "now there are more than a hundred."<sup>12</sup> Moreover, the people who tor­ture are 
            no longer the villains but the heroes of prime-time television. The most cel­ebrated 
            is, ofcourse, Jack Bauer, the tragic-ethical hero of the wildly popular Fox 
            TV thriller 24. Not only is torture the main thread of the plot, often presented 
            "with gusto and no moral compunction,"<sup>13</sup> but Bauer is portrayed as a patriot rather 
            than a depraved monster who tortures in order to protect American lives and national
            security. Torture in this scenario takes society's ultimate betrayal of human dignity and 
            legitimates the pain and fear it produces as normal, all the while making a "moral 
            sadist" a television celebrity."<sup>14</sup> The show, before its final season in 2010, had over 
            15 million viewers, and its glamorization of torture had proven so successful that 
            it appears not only to have numbed the public's reaction to the horrors of torture, 
            but it became so overwhelmingly influential among the U.S. military that the 
            Pentagon sent Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan to California to meet with the 
            producers of the show. He told them that promoting illegal behaviour in the 
            series. . .was having a damaging effect on young troops."<sup>15</sup> The pornographic 
            glo­rification of gratuitous, sadistic violence is also on full display in the popular I-IBO 
            television series Dexter, which portrays a serial killer as a sympathetic, even lovable 
            character. The Starz television series Spartacus: Blood and Sand takes the aesthetic of 
            blood and violence beyond what one might call the pornography of violence. This 
            series, a version of Fight Club on steroids, has more in common with the ideology 
            and mechanisms of the fascist spectacle-at once a celebration of a ruthless form 
            of hyper-masculinity, Social Darwinism, and an investment in violence as the most
            important element of power and mediating force in shaping social relationships.<sup>16</sup></p>

          <p>Violence in this series is more than grotesque; it is morally bankrupt and embraces 
            the spectacle to both entertain and provoke the most dcbased type ofvoyeurism. If 
            The celebration of hyper-violence and torture travels easily from fiction to real 
            life with the emergence in the past few years of a proliferation of "bum fight" videos 
            on the Internet "shot by young men and boys who are seen beating the homeless 
            or who pay transients a few dollars to fight each other."<sup>17</sup> The culture of cruelty 
            mimics cinematic violence as the agents of abuse both indulge in actual forms of 
            violence and then fhrther celebrate the barbarity by posting it on the Web, mimic­king 
            the desire for fame and recognition, while voyeuristically consuming their own 
            violent cultural productions. The National Coalition for the Homeless claims that 
            "On YouTube in July 2009, people have posted 85,900 videos with 'bum' in the title 
            [and] 5,690 videos can be found with the title 'bum fight,' representing. . .an increase 
            of 1,460 videos since April 2008."<sup>18</sup> Rather than problematize violence, popular 
            cul­ture increasingly normalizes it, often in ways that border on criminal intent. For 
            instance, a recent issue of Maxim, a popular men's magazine, included "a blurb titled 
            'Hunt the Homeless' [focusing on] a coming 'hobo convention' in Iowa and says 'Kill 
            one for fun. We're 87 percent sure it's legal.'"<sup>19</sup> In this context violence is not 
            sim­ply being transformed into an utterly distasteful form of adolescent entertainment 
            or spectacularized to attract readers and boost profits, it becomes a powerful 
            ped­agogical force in the culture of cruelty by both aligning itself and becoming 
            com­plicit with the very real surge of violence against the homeless, often committed by 
            young men and teenage boys looking for a thrill.<sup>20</sup> Spurred on by the ever-reassur­ing 
            presence of violence and dehumanization in the wider culture, these young "thrill 
            offenders" now search out the homeless and "punch, kick, shoot or set afire people 
            living on the streets, frequently killing them, simply for the sport of it, their victims 
            all but invisible to society."<sup>21</sup> All of these elements of popular culture speak 
            stylish­ly and sadistically to new ways in which to maximize the pleasure of violence, giv­ing 
            it its hip (if fascist) edginess.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Everyday Violence and<br>
          the Culture of Cruelty, iv</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Needless to say, neither violent video games and television series nor Hollywood 
            films and the Internet (or, for that matter, popular culture) cause in any direct sense 
            real-world violence and suffering, but they do not leave the real world behind, either. 
            That is too simplistic. What they do achieve is the execution of a well-fiinded and 
            highly seductive public pedagogical enterprise that sexualizes and stylizes 
            represen­tations of violence, investing them with an intense pleasure quotient. I don't 
            believe it is an exaggeration to claim that the violence of screen culture entertains 
            and cleanses young people of the burden of ethical considerations when they, for 
            instance, play video games that enable them to "casually kill the simulated human beings 
            whose world they control."<sup>22</sup> Hollywood films such as the Saw series offer 
            up a form of torture porn in which the spectacle of the violence enhances not mere­ly 
            its attraction but offers young viewers a space where questions of ethics and 
            responsibility are gleefully suspended, enabling them to evade their complicity in 
            a culture of cruelty. No warnings appear on the labels of these violent videos and 
            films suggesting that the line between catharsis and desensitization may become 
            blurred, making it more difficult for them to raise questions about what it means 
            "to live in a society that produces, markets, and supports such products."<sup>23</sup></p>

          <p>But these hyper-violent cultural products also form part of a corrupt pedagog­ical 
            assemblage and cultural apparatus that makes it all the more difficult to recog­nize 
            the hard realities of power and material violence at work through militarism,
            a winner-take-all economy marked by punishing inequalities, and a national secu­rity 
            state that exhibits an utter disregard for human suffering. In this version of zom­bie 
            politics, death is spectacularized in order to evade matters of politics and 
            power~even the suffering of children, we must note, as when govemment officials 
            reduce the lives of babies and young children lost in Iraq and Afghanistan to col­lateral 
            damage. Tragically, the crime here is much more than symbolic. The ideology of hardness 
            and cruelty runs through American culture like an electric current, sapping the strength 
            of social relations and individual character, moral compassion, and collective action, 
            offering up crimes against humanity that become fodder for video games and spectacularized 
            media infotainment, and con­structing a culture of cruelty that promotes a "symbiosis of 
            suffering and spectacle."<sup>24</sup></p>

          <p>As Chris Hedges argues,</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Sadism is as much a part of popular culture as it is of corporate culture. lt dominates
            pornography, runs. . .through reality television and trash-talk programs and is at the core of
            the compliant, corporate collective. Corporatism is about crushing the capacity for moral
            choice. And it has its logical fruition in Abu Ghraib, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and
            our Igcsk of compassion for the homeless, our poor, the mentally ill, the unemployed and the
            sick.<sup>25</sup></p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>Bailouts are not going to address the ways in which individual desires, values, and 
            identities are endlessly produced in the service of a culture of cruelty and inequal­ity. 
            Power is not merely material, it is also symbolic and is distributed through a soci­ety 
            in ways we have never seen before. No longer is education about schooling. It now 
            functions through the educational force of the larger culture in the media, Internet, 
            electronic media, and through a wide range of technologies and sites endlessly working 
            to undo democratic values, compassion, and any viable notion of 
            justice and its accompanying social relations. What this suggests is a redefinition 
            of both literacy and education. We need as a society to educate students and oth­ers to 
            be literate in multiple ways, to reclaim the high ground of civic courage, and to be 
            able to name, engage, and transform those forms of public pedagogy that pro­duce hate 
            and cruelty as part of the discourse of common sense. Otherwise, democ­racy will 
            lose the supportive institutions, social relations, and culture that make it 
            not only possible but even thinkable.</p>

          Hysteria and<br>
          the Politics of<br>
          Death</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>If we take seriously the ideology, arguments, and values now emanating from the 
            right wing of the Republican Party, there is no room in the United States for a 
            democracy in which the obligations of citizenship, compassion, and collective 
            security outweigh the demands of what might be called totalizing market-driven 
            society, that is, a society that is utterly deregulated, privatized, commodificd, and 
            largely controlled by the ultra-rich and a handful of mega-corporations. In such a 
            society, there is a shift in power from government to markets and the emergence 
            of a more intensified political economy organized around three principal con­cerns: 
            deregulated markets, commodification, and disposability. In spite of the 
            current failure of this system, right-wing Republicans and their allies are more than 
            willing to embrace a system that erases all vestiges of the public good, turning 
            cit­izens into consumers, while privatizing and commodifying every aspect of the 
            social order-all the while threatening the lives, health, and livelihoods of millions 
            of working-class and middle-class people.</p>

          <p>If we listen to shockjocks on right-wing talk radio and an increasing number 
            of their ilk in other media-driven spheres, casino capitalism is not only sexy, it 
            pro­vides an argument against the very notion of politics itself and the power of the 
            gov­ernment to intervene and protect its citizens from the ravages of nature, corrupt 
            institutions, and an unregulated market. In this discourse, largely buttressed through 
            an appeal to fear and the use of outright lies, free-market capitalism assumes an 
            almost biblical status as an argument against the power of government to protect 
            its citizens from misfortune and the random blows of fate by providing the most 
            basic rights and levels of collective security and protection. Politics in this scenario 
            is left to the fate of markets and the financial hyper-dead, while everyone else has 
            to look out for themselves, bereft of any social protections or collective help from 
            broader social spheres.</p>

          <p>Before he died, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt advocated precisely for 
            such rights, which he called a "second bill of rights," and which included the right 
            "of every family to a decent home. The right to adequate medical care and the 
            oppor­tunity to achieve and enjoy good health. The right to adequate protection from 
            the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident and unemployment. The right to a 
            good education."<sup>1</sup> That is, those social and economic rights that provide a secure 
            foun­dation for people to live with dignity and be free to become critical and 
            engaged cit­izens, capable of both expanding their own sense of agency and freedom 
            while being able to work with others to fulfill the demands of an aspiring democracy.</p>

          <p>But in the truncated notion of freedom espoused by the right-wing extremists 
            of casino capitalism, democracy is a deficit, if not a pathology, and freedom is 
            reduced to the narrow logic of an almost rabid focus on self-interest. As I pointed 
            out in the Introduction, this is a truncated version of freedom, defined largely as 
            free­dom from constraint-a freedom which when not properly exercised or balanced 
            loses its connection to those obligations that tie people to values, issues, and 
            insti­tutions that affirm "the existence of a common good or a public purpose."<sup>2</sup> 
            Freedom here operates according to a calculated deficit that reduces agency to a 
            regressive infantilism, or what Leo Lowenthal called "the atomization of the 
            individual," ter­rorized by other human beings, and reduced to "living in a state 
            of stupor, in a moral coma."<sup>3</sup> This type of depoliticizing inward thinking, with 
            its disavowal of the obligations of social responsibility and its outright disdain 
            for those who are dis­advantaged by virtue of being poor, young, or elderly, does 
            more than fuel the harsh, militarized, and hyper-masculine logic of reality 
            television and extreme sports. It also elevates death over life, selfishness 
            over compassion, and economics over politics. But more so, it produces a kind 
            of dysfunctional silence in the culture in the face of massive hardship and 
            suffering, wiping out society's collective mem­ories of moral decency.</p>

          <p>There is more than moral indifference and political cynicism at work here. 
            There is also a culture in which there is not much room for ideals, a culture that now 
            considers public welfare a pathology, and responsibility solely a privatized and 
            individual matter. Under this form of zombie politics and mode of casino capital­ism, 
            people become invested in their own survival, narrowly focused on their own 
            interests, all the while confirming their regression into a Social Darwinism echoed 
            daily on reality TV. This is a politics of disinvestment in public life, democracy, and 
            the common good. Hence, it is not surprising that we hear nothing from the faux 
            populists Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and other cheerleaders for an 
            unchecked capitalism about a market-driven landscape filled with desolate 
            commu­nities, gutted public services, and weakened labor unions. Nor do they say 
            anything about a free-market system that in its greed, cruelty, corruption, and 
            iniquitous power relations creates the conditions responsible for 40 million 
            impoverished people (many living in their cars or the ever-growing tent cities), 
            and 46 million Americans, until recently, living without health insurance-one result 
            of which, according to a Harvard University study, has been the needless deaths of 
            45,000 peo­ple every year.<sup>4</sup> Nor do they register any alarm over a system that, 
            according to a recent study released by the Johns Hopkins Children's Center, 
            claims that "lack of adequate health care may have contributed to the deaths of 
            some 17,000 U.S. chil­dren over the past two decades."<sup>5</sup> What do they have to say 
            about a deregulated mar­ket system with its corrupt financial institutions shipping 
            jobs abroad, swindling people out of their homes, and gutting the manufacturing base 
            of U.S. industry?</p>

          <p>What do they have to say about a political system largely controlled by corporate 
            lobbyists? 0r insurance companies that pay employees bonuses when they main­tain a 
            high level of rejections f`or procedures that can save people's lives. Not much. 
            All they see amid this growing landscape of human suffering and despair is the 
            specter of socialism, which amounts to any government-sponsored program 
            designed to offer collective insurance in the face of misfortune and promote the 
            pub­lic good.</p>

          <p>For many conservatives and right-wing extremists, a market-driven society 
            represents more than a tirade against "big government." It constitutes a new kind 
            of politics that privileges exchange values and quick profits over all non-commod­ified 
            values, resists all forms of government intervention (except when it benefits 
            the rich and powerful and the defense industry), celebrates excessive individualism, 
            and consolidates the power of the rich along with powerful corporations-current­ly 
            coded as mammoth financial institutions such as the insurance companies, 
            phar­maceutical companies, and big banks. Moreover, the ability of this previously 
            devalued market-driven system to endlessly come back to life is truly astonishing. 
            How can the Dick Armeys of the world be featured in Tb: New York Times as if their 
            ideology and ruthlessness is worthy of a major news story? How is it that an end­less 
            number of ex and current politicians who are wedded at the hip to corporate 
            interests can be taken seriously as spokespersons for the larger public?</p>

          <p>As the fog of social and historical amnesia rolls over the media and the coun­try 
            in general, it does so in spite of the financial tsunami unleashed in 2008, the 
            debacle following Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf oil crisis, and the in-your-face 
            pay­out of big bonuses by institutions that were bailed out by the government. Clearly, 
            market fundamentalism is alive and well in the United States, suggesting that it also 
            works hard through the related modalities of education and seduction to induce the 
            public to conform to the narrow dictates, values, and dreams of totalizing market 
            society, regardless of how disruptive it is of their lives. Shouting against the evils of 
            big government does little to register or make visible the power of big corporations 
            or a govemment that serves corporate rather than democratic needs. Even as an 
            eco­logical disaster looms along the Gulf Coast, there seems to be little analysis of how
            then Vice President Dick Cheney secretly convened the oil companies in order to 
            set the standards for energy policy in the United States, setting the stage for 
            even­tual disasters such as the recent deep-sea oil leak in the Gulf that could have been 
            prevented with proper government oversight. Nor is there any public outrage of how 
            casino capitalism's most treasured formula of short-term investments for quick 
            profits ignores the possibility of deadly social costs, especially regrettable as BP 
            devoted little time to creating contingent plans in the event that one of its offshore 
            oil wells failed, which, of course, it did. Such an investment would have cut into 
            quick profits, and now billions will be spent, most likely taxpayers' money, to fix the 
            ecological and human damage done along one of the most beautiful coastlines in 
            America.</p>

          Hysteria and<br>
          the Politics of<br>
          Death, iii</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>What is unique and particularly disturbing about this hyper-market-driven 
            notion of economics is that it makes undemocratic modes of education central to 
            its politics and employs a mode of pedagogy aimed at displacing and shutting 
            down all vestiges of the public sphere that cannot be commodified, privatized, and 
            commercialized. Consumers are in and citizens are out. Fear-mongering and lying 
            are the discourses of choice, while dialogue and thoughtfiilness are considered 
            weakness. To a greater extent than at any other point in liberal modemity, this regime 
            of Economic Darwinism now extends economic rationality "to formerly noneco­nomic 
            domains [shaping] individual conduct, or more precisely, [prescribing] the 
            citizen-subject of the neoliberal order."<sup>6</sup> Most crucially, this struggle over the 
            con­struction of the market-driven consumer-subject, especially as it applies to young 
            people, is by and large waged outside of formal educational institutions, in 
            peda­gogical sites and spaces that are generally privatized and extend from the tradition­al 
            and new media to conservative-funded think tanks and private schools.<sup>7</sup> As 
            corporate-controlled spheres and commodity markets assume a commanding role 
            educating young and old alike, pedagogy is redefined as a tool of commerce 
            aggres­sively promoting the commodification of young people and the destruction of 
            non-commodified public spaces and institutions. I-low else to explain that it is
            almost impossible to read about educational reform in the dominant media except
            as a tool to educate people for the workforce? In other words, education is a form
            of commerce and nothing more. Education for democracy today sounds a lot like
            the idea that health care for everyone is socialism. Clearly, what we are witnessing
            here is not just the rise of political theater or media-driven spectacle in American
            society but a populism that harbors a deep disdain for democracy and no longer
            understands how to define itself outside of the imperatives of capital accumulation, 
            shopping, and the willingness to view more and more individuals and groups as sim­ply 
            disposable, waste products no longer worthy of the blessings of consumption.</p>

          <p>As moral and ethical considerations are decoupled from the calculating logic 
            and consequences of all economic activity, the horrendous human toll in suffering 
            and hardship being visited upon all segments of the American population is lost in 
            the endless outburst of anger, if not hysteria, promoted by right-wing extremists 
            shouting for a return to the good old days when financial institutions and money 
            markets set policy, eventually ushering in one of the most serious economic crises 
            this country has ever faced. As the values of human solidarity, community, friend­ 
            ship, and love are once again subordinated to the notion that only markets can give 
            people what they want, the culture of fear and cruelty grows in proportion to the 
            angry protests, the threat of violence, and the unapologetic racism aimed at the 
            Obama administration. In part, this is exemplified in not only the endless public 
            pronouncements that make a market society and democracy synonymous but also 
            in the ongoing celebration, in spite of the near collapse of the mortgage sector, of 
            the excesses of the new Gilded Age. Like those reanimated corpses that endlessly 
            return in such classic zombie films as Dawn #the Dead, right-wing Republicans and 
            Democrats are back shouting from every conceivable platform to demolish any ves­tige 
            of reform that relies on "big government." The right-wing infatuation with the 
            word "death," as in the fictitious claim about Obama's death panels, is telling-more 
            a projection of their own politics than a serious critique of health care reform leg­islation. 
            Despite a change in U.S. political leadership, these forces, if left unchecked, 
            will continue to promote and fight for a transformation of democratic governance 
            and citizenship until they are both completely destroyed.</p>

            <p>As democracy is increasingly reduced to an empty shell and the rise of a 
            cor­porate and punishing state looms heavily on the twenty-first-century horizon, the 
            market-driven principles of deregulation, radical individualism, and privatization 
            penetrate all aspects of daily life. Such market-driven values and their accompany­ing 
            power-shaping institutions now profoundly influence the very nature of how 
            Americans think, act, and desire. All of which are increasingly wedded to the 
            epi­center of a grotesque consumer culture, whose underside is a heartless indifference 
            to the suffering and hardship of the millions of people without jobs, homes, 
            childcare, and, increasingly, hope. The current fight against immigration and real 
            edu­cational reform is not really just about fixing a terribly iniquitous and broken 
            sys­tem. lt is a struggle against the prospect of a better future for young people, 
            the poor, the excluded, and those struggling to stay alive in America. What are we 
            to make of an ideology that moves from dismantling the welfare state to embracing 
            the pun­ishing state, an ideology that increasingly turns its back on those individuals 
            for whom the prisons are now deputized as the only welfare institutions left in America, 
            or, if they are lucky, who find themselves in one of the emerging tent cities found 
            under bridges and located in other invisible landscapewused in the past to get rid 
            of waste products, but now used to dump poor working-class and middle-class fam­ilies.

          <p>Where is this hysteria going, given that we now have in office an administra­tion 
            that refuses to fight for the ideals it campaigned on? We get a glimpse of where 
            it is going in the tirades let loose recently by people like Sarah Palin, a dumber-than­ 
            dumb version of Ayn Rand, and Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of 
            Minnesota who, when she is not calling for members of Congress to be investigat­ed 
            for their communist sympathies, is railing against Obama's socialism. In lead­ing 
            crowds in Washington, DC, with the chant, "kill the bill," Bachmann displayed 
            not simply an angry protest against health care reform. On the contrary, there is a 
            much broader notion of politics at stake here, one in which she and others are 
            protesting for an utterly privatized and commodified society where corporations and 
            markets define politics while matters of life and death are removed from ethical 
            con­siderations, increasingly subject to cost-benefit analyses and the calculations of 
            potential proiit margins. In this scenario, each individual is on his or her own in 
            con­fronting the many systemic problems facing American society, each of us 
            respon­sible for our own fate, even when facing systemic problems that cannot be solved 
            by isolated individuals. This politics of hysteria and ruthlessness that is now on hill 
            display in America is not just an attack on the social state, big govemment, the 
            pub­lic sphere, and the common good but on the very essence of politics and democra­cy. 
            This is truly a politics of the hyper-dead, a zombie politics that celebrates death 
            over life.

          Bush's Legacy and<br>
          Democracy's<br>
          Failure</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Nowhere is there a more disturbing, if not horrifying, example of the relation­ship 
            between a culture of cruelty and the zombie politics of irresponsibility than in the 
            resounding silence that surrounds the torture of children under the pres­idency of 
            George W. Bush-and the equal moral and political failure of the Obama administration 
            to address and rectify the conditions that made it possible. But if we are to draw 
            out the dark and hidden parameters of such crimes, they must be made visible so men 
            and women can once again refuse to orphan the law, justice, and morality. How we deal 
            with the issue of state terrorism and its complicity with the torture of children 
            will determine not merely the conditions under which we are willing to live but whether 
            we will live in a society in which moral responsibil­ity disappears altogether and 
            whether we will come to find ourselves living under either a democratic or 
            authoritarian social order. This is not merely a political and ethical matter but also 
            a matter of how we take seriously the task of educating our­ selves more critically 
            in the fixture.</p>

          <p>We haven't always looked away. When Emmett Till's battered, brutalized, and broken 
            14-year-old body was open to public viewing in Chicago after he was murdered in 
            Mississippi in 1955, his mother refused to have him interred in a closed casket. His 
            mutilated and swollen head, his face disfigured and missing an eye, made him 
            unrecognizable as the young, handsome boy he once was. The torture, humil­iation, 
            and pain this innocent African American youth endured at the hands of white racists 
            was transformed into a sense of collective outrage and pain, and helped launch the 
            Civil Rights movement. Torture when inflicted on children becomes indefensible. Even 
            among those who believe that torture is a defensible practice to extract information, 
            the case for inflicting pain and abuse upon children proves impossible to support. The 
            image of young children being subjected to pro­longed standing, handcuffed to the top 
            of a cell door, doused with cold water, raped, and shocked with electrodes boggles 
            the mind. These corrupting, degener­ate, and despicable practices reveal the utter 
            moral depravity underlying the ratio­nales used to defend torture as a viable war 
            tactic.</p>

            <p>There is an undeniable pathological outcome when the issue of national secu­rity 
            becomes more important than the survival of morality itself resulting in some cases in 
            the deaths of thousands of children-and with little public outrage. For instance, then 
            Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, appearing on the national tele­vision program 60 
            Minutcs in 1996, was asked by Leslie Stahl for her reaction to the killing of half a 
            million Iraqi children in five years as a result of the U.S. block­ade. Stahl pointedly 
            asked her, "We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean, that's more 
            children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?" Albright 
            replied, "I think this is a very hard choice, but the price-we think the price is 
            worth it."<sup>1</sup> The comment was barely reported in the mainstream media and 
            produced no outrage among the American public. As Rahul Mahajan points out, "The 
            inference that Albright and the terrorists may have shared a com­mon rationale-a 
            belief that the deaths of thousands of innocents are a price worth paying to achieve 
            one's political ends-does not seem to be one that can be made in the U.S. mass media."<sup>2</sup></p>

          <p>More recentlyg Michael Haas has argued that in spite of the ample evidence that 
            the United States has both detained and abused what may be hundreds of children 
            in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo, there has been almost no public debate 
            about the issue and precious few calls for prosecuting those responsible for the 
            tor­ture. He writes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The mistreatment of children is something not so funny that has been neglected on 
            the road to investigations of and calls for prosecution of those responsible for 
            torture. George W. Bush has never been asked about the abuse of children in 
            American-run prisons in the "war on terror." It is high time for Bush and others to be 
            held accountable for what is arguably the most egregious of all their war crimewthe 
            abuse and death of children, who should never have been anestcd in the first place. 
            The best kept secret of Bush's war crimes is that thou­sands of children have been 
            imprisoned, tortured, and otherwise denied rights under the Geneva Conventions and 
            related international agreements. Yet both Congress and the media have strangely 
            failed to identify the very existence of child prisoners as a war crime.<sup>3</sup></p>

          Failure, ii</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>While it is difficult to confirm how many children have actually been detained, 
            sex­ually abused, and tortured by the Bush administration, there is ample evidence that 
            such practices have taken place not only from the accounts of numerous journal­ists 
            but also in a number of legal reports. One of the most profoundly disturbing 
            and documented cases of the torture of a child in the custody of U.S. forces is that 
            of Mohammed Jawad, who was captured in Afghanistan after he allegedly threw a 
            hand grenade at a military vehicle that injured an Afghan interpreter and two U.S. 
            soldiers. He was immediately arrested by the local Afghan police, who tortured him 
            and consequently elicited a confession from him. An Afghan Attorney General, in 
            a letter to the U.S. government, claimed that jawad was 12 years old when captured, 
            indicating that he was still in primary school, though other sources claim he was 
            around 15 or 16.<sup>4</sup> ]awad denied the charges made against him by the Afghan 
            police, claiming that "they tortured me.They beat me. They beat me a lot. One per­son 
            told me, 'If you don't confess, they are going to kill you.' So, I told them any­
            thing they wanted to hear."<sup>5</sup></p>
          <p>On the basis of a confession obtained through torture, Jawad was turned over 
            to U.S. forces and detained first at Bagram and later at Guantanamo. This child, 
            caught in the wild zone of permanent war and illegal legalities, has spent more than 
            six years as a detainee. Unfortunately, the Obama administration, even after admit­ting 
            that Jawad had been tortured illegally; has asked the court to detain him so that 
            it can decide whether or not it Wallt's to bring a criminal charge against him. After 
            a federal judge claimed the government's case was "riddled with holes," the Obama 
            administration decided it would no longer consider Jawad a "military detainee but 
            would be held for possible prosecution in American civilian courts."<sup>6</sup> This shame­ful 
            decision takes place against any sense of reason or modicum of morality and 
            jus­tice.</p>
          <p>Even Jawad's former military prosecutor, Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld, a Bronze Star 
            recipient, has stated that there "is no credible evidence or legal basis" to con­tinue 
            his detention and that he does not represent a risk to anyone.<sup>7</sup> In an 
            affidavit filed with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he claimed "that 
            at least three other Afghans had been arrested for the crime and had subsequently 
            confessed, casting considerable doubt on the claim that Mr. Jawad was solely 
            responsible for the attack."<sup>8</sup> It gets worse: Vandeveld also pointed out 
            that the confession obtained by the Afghan police and used as the cornerstone of the 
            Bush administrations case against Jawad could not have been written by him because 
            "Jawad was fictional­ly illiterate and could not read or write [and] the statement was 
            not even in his native language of Pashto."<sup>9</sup> The ACLU points out that 
            "the written statement [that] allegedly contain[s] Mohammed's confession and thumb 
            print is in Farsi," which Jawad does not read, write, or speak.<sup>10</sup></p>
          <p>Vandeveld was so repulsed by the fact that all of the evidence used against Jawad 
            was forcibly obtained through torture that he "first demanded that Jawad be released, 
            then, when Bush officials refused, unsuccessfully demanded to be relieved of his duty 
            to prosecute and then finally resigned."<sup>11</sup> Since resigning, he is now a 
            key witness in Jawad's defense and works actively with the ACLU to get him 
            released. As Bob Herbert has written, "There is no credible evidence against Jawad, 
            and his torture-induced confession has rightly been ruled inadmissible by a 
            mili­tary judge. But the administration does not feel that he has suffered enough."<sup>12</sup> 
            And yet Jawad was the subject of egregious and repugnant acts of torture from the 
            moment he was captured in Afghanistan and later turned over to American forces.</p>
          <p>In a sworn affidavit, Colonel Vandeveld stated that Jawad had undergone 
            extensive abuse at Bagram for approximately two months: "The abuse included the 
            slapping of Mr. Jawad across the face while Mr. Jawad's head was covered with a 
            hood, as well as Mr. Jawad's having been shoved down a stairwell while both hood­ed 
            and shackled."<sup>13</sup> As soon as Jawad arrived at Bagram, the abuse began, with him 
            being forced to pose for nude photographs and undergo a strip search in front of a 
            number of witnesses. He was also blindfolded and hooded while interrogated and 
            "told to hold on to a water bottle that he believed was actually a bomb that could 
            explode at any moment."<sup>14</sup> In addition, while in the custody of U.S. forces, he was 
            subjected to severe abuse and torture. According to the ACLU:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>U.S. personnel subjected Mohammed to beatings, forced him into so-called "stress positions," 
            forcibly hooded him, placed him in physical and linguistic isolation, pushed him down stairs, 
            chained him to a wall for prolonged periods, and subjected him to threats including threats 
            to kill him, and other intimidation. U.S. forces also subjected Mohammed to sleep 
            depri­vation; interrogators' notes indicate that Mohammed was so disoriented at one point that 
            he did not know whether it was day or night. Mohammed was also intimidated, frightened 
            and deeply disturbed by the sounds of screams from other prisoners and rumours of other 
            prisoners being beaten to death.<sup>15</sup></p>

          Democracy's<br>
          Failure, iii</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>The specifics of the conditions at Bagram under which Jawad was confined as a child
            are spelled out in a military interrogator's report:</p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>While at the BCP (Bagram Collection Point) he described the isolation cell as a small room
            on the second floor made of wood .... He stated that while he was held in the isolation cells,
            they kept him restrained in handcuffs and a hood over his head, also making him drink lots
            of water. He said the guards made him stand up and if he sat down, he would be
            beaten .... [He] stated that he was made to stand to keep him from sleeping and said when
            he sat down the guards would open the cell door, grab him by the throat and stand him up.</p>

          <p>He said they would also kick him and make him fall over, as he was wearing leg shackles
            and was unable to take large steps. He said the guards would fasten his handcuffs to the 
            iso­lation cell door so he would be unable to sit down .... [He] said due to being kicked and ­
            beating at the BCR he experienced chest pains and dificulty with urination."<sup>16</sup></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The interrogations, abuse, and isolation daily proved so debilitating physically and
            mentally that Jawad told military personnel at Bagram that he was contemplating
            suicide. What must be kept in mind is that this victim of illegal abuse and torture
            was only a juvenile, still in his teens and not even old enough to vote in the United
            States. Unfortunately, the torture and abuse of this child continued as he was trans­ferred 
            to Guantanamo. Starved for three days before the trip, given only sips of water, 
            he arrived in Cuba on February 3, 2003, and was subjected to physical and linguistic 
            isolation for 30 days-the only human contact being with interrogators. 
            In October 2003, he underwent another 30-day period of solitary confinement. The
            interrogators displayed a ruthlessness with this young boy that is hard to imagine,
            all in the absence of legal counsel for Jawad. For instance, "Military records from
            throughout 2003 indicate that Mohammed repeatedly cried and asked for his
            mother during interrogation. Upon information and belief; before one interroga­tion, 
            Mohammed fainted, complained of dizziness and stomach pain, but was 
            given an IV and forced to go through with the interrogation."<sup>17</sup> Driven to despair 
            over his treatment, Jawad attempted suicide on December 25, 2003. Hints of such 
            despair had been observed by one interrogator, who approached a military psychol­ogist 
            and asked that the "techniques being applied to Jawad should be temporari­ly 
            halted because they were causing him to dissociate, to crack up without providing 
            good information."<sup>18</sup></p>

          <p>These techniques were particularly severe and, as Meteor Blades points out, can
            cause "physical deterioration, panic, rage, loss of appetite, lethargy, paranoia, 
            hallu­cinations, self-mutilation, cognitive dysfunction, disorientation and mental 
            break­ downs, any of which, alone or in combination, can spur the detainee to give 
            interrogators more information than he might otherwise surrender."<sup>l9</sup> Not only did 
            Army Lieutenant Colonel Diane M. Zeirhoffer, a licensed psychologist, refuse to 
            stop the abuse, which she had ordered; she also-according to the testimony of 
            Lieutenant Colonel Vandeveld-engaged in a psychological assessment not to 
            "assist in identifying and treating any emotional or psychological disturbances Mr. 
            Jawad might have been suffering from. It was instead conducted to assist the 
            inter­rogators in extracting information from Mr. Jawad, even exploiting his mental 
            vul­nerabilities to do so .... From my perspective, this officer had employed his or 
            her professional training and expertise in a profoundly unethical manner."<sup>20</sup></p>

          <p>This is an egregious example of how the war on ICITOI, its reign of illegal 
            legal­ities, and its supportive culture of cruelty transforms members of a profession 
            who take an oath to "do no harm" into military thugs who use their professional 
            skills in the service of CIA and military interrogations and detainee torture-even 
            the almost unspeakable torture of juveniles. The abuse of Jawad, bordering on 
            Gestapo­ like sadism, continued after his attempted suicide. From May 7-20, 2004, he was 
            subjected to what military interrogators called the "frequent flyer" program, which 
            was a systemic regime of sleep disruption and deprivation. In order to disrupt his 
            sleep cycle, Jawad, according to military records, "was moved between two differ­ent 
            cells 112 times, on average every two hours and 50 minutes, day and night. Every 
            time he was moved, he was shackled."<sup>21</sup> As a result of this abuse, "Mohammed's 
            medical records indicate that significant health effects he suffered during this time 
            include blood in his urine, bodily pain, and a weight loss of 10% from April 2004 
            to May 2004."<sup>22</sup> At a June 2008 military commission hearing, Jawad's U.S. military 
            lawyer inquired as to why "someone in a position of authority and not just the 
            guards" was not being held accountable for Jawad's subjection to the "frequent 
            flyer" program.<sup>23</sup> The government refused to supply any names or prosecute any­ 
            one involved in the program, citing their right to privacy, as if such a right overrides 
            "allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
            punish­ment and the right of victims of human rights violations to remedy."<sup>24</sup></p>

          Bush's Legacy and<br>

          Failure, iv</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>The torture and abuse of the child detainee Mohammed Jawad continued up 
            to about June 2, 2008, when he was "beaten, kicked, and pepper-sprayed while he 
            was on the ground with his feet and hands in shackles, for allegedly not 
            comply­ing with guards' instructions. Fifteen days later, there were still 
            visible marks con­sistent with physical abuse on his body, including his arms, 
            knees, shoulder, forehead, and ribs."<sup>25</sup> How the Obama administration could possibly 
            defend building a criminal case against Mohammed Jawad, given that he was under 18 
            years of age at the time of his arrest and had endured endless years of torture and 
            abuse at the hands of the U.S. government, raises serious questions about the 
            ethical and polit­ical integrity of this government and its alleged commitment 
            to human rights.</p>

          <p>The case against this young man was so weak that Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle 
            has not only accused the government of "dragging [the case] out for no good rea­son," 
            but also expressed alarm at how weak the government's case was, stating in a 
            refusal to give them an extension to amass new evidence against Jawad, "You'd bet­ter 
            go consult real quick with the powers that be, because this is a case that's been 
            screaming at everybody for years. This case is an outrage to me .... I am not going 
            to sit up here and wait for you to come up with new evidence at this late hour...</p>

          <p>This case is in shambles."<sup>26</sup> On July 30, 2009, Judge Huvelle ordered the Obama 
            administration to release Jawad by late August. She stated, "After this horrible, long, 
            tortured history, I hope the government will succeed in getting him back 
            home .... Enough has been imposed on this young man to date."<sup>27</sup> The New York 
            Times reported, in what can only be interpreted as another example of bad faith on 
            the part of the Obama administration, that the justice Department responded to 
            Judge Huvelle's ruling by suggesting that "they were studying whether to file civil­ian 
            criminal charges against Mr. Jawad. If they do, officials say, he could be 
            trans­ferred to the United States to face charges, instead of being sent to Afghanistan, 
            where his lawyers say he would be released to his mother."<sup>28</sup> In August of 2009, 
            Mohammed Jawad was flown from Cuba to Afghanistan and released to his fam­ily. The U.S. 
            government claims the criminal investigation is still open, but the 
            chance of such an investigation taking place is now unlikely.</p>

          <p>Even more disturbing are statements by Jawad's defense lawyers claiming that 
            the witnesses who may be used in bringing a criminal case against Jawad were paid 
            by the government for their testimony. According to U.S. Marine Corps Major Eric 
            Montalvo, one of Jawad's lawyers, all of the alleged witnesses "received some sort 
            of U.S. govemment compensation, from shoes and a trip to the United States to 
            $400 for cooperation, which is a princely sum in Afghanistan."<sup>29</sup> This type of 
            moral deception and sleazy illegality is straight from the playbook of high-level 
            Republican operatives in the Bush/Cheney administration. Moreover, this response 
            goes to the heart of the contradiction between Obama as an iconic symbol of a more 
            democratic and hopeful future and the reality of an administration that is capable 
            of reproducing some of the worst policies of the Bush administration.</p>

          <p>Jawad's case is about more than legal incompetence. It is also about the descent 
            into the "dark side" of a zombie politics where a culture of cruelty reigns and the 
            rule of law is on the side of the most frightening of antidemocratic practices, point­ing 
            to a society in which terror becomes as totalizing as the loss of any sense of eth­ical 
            responsibility. Torture of this type, especially of a child, would appear to have 
            more in common with the techniques used by the Cvestapo, Pol Pot, the Pinochet 
            thugs in Chile, and the military junta in Argentina in the 1970s rather than with 
            the United States-or at least the democratic country the United States has histor­ically 
            claimed to be.</p>

          Zombie Theater and<br>
          the Spectacle of<br>
          Illiteracy</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Wright Mills argued fifty years ago that one important measure of the demise of 
            vibrant democracy and the corresponding impoverishment of political life can be found 
            in the increasing inability ofa society to translate private troubles to broader 
            public issues.<sup>1</sup> This is an issue that both characterizes and threat­ensens 
            any viable notion of democracy in the United States in the current historical moment. 
            In an alleged post-racist democracy, the image of the public sphere with its appeal
            to dialogue and shared responsibility has given way to 
            the spectacle of unbridled intolerance, ignorance, seething private fears, 
            unchecked anger, and the decoupling of reason from freedom. Increasingly, as 
            witnessed in the utter disre­spect and not-so-latent racism expressed by Joe Wilson, 
            the Republican congress­man from South Carolina, who shouted "You lie!" during 
            President Obama's address on health care, the obligation to listen, respect the 
            views of others, and engage in a literate exchange is increasingly reduced to the 
            highly spectacularized embrace of an infantile emotionalism. This is an emotionalism 
            that is made for tele­vision. It is perfectly suited for emptying the language of 
            public life of all substan­tive content, reduced in the end to a playground for 
            hawking commodities, promoting celebrity culture, and enacting the spectacle of 
            right-wing fantasies fueled by the fear that the public sphere as an exclusive 
            club for white male Christians is in danger of collapsing. For some critics, those
            who carry guns to ral­lies or claim Obama is a Muslim and not a bona fide citizen 
            of the United States are simply representative of an extremist fringe that gets 
            far more publicity from the mainstream media than they deserve. Of course this is 
            understandable, given that the media's desire for balance and objective news is not 
            just disengenuous but relinquishes any sense of ethical responsibility by failing to 
            make a distinction between an informed argument and an unsubstantiated opinion. 
            Witness the racist hysteria unleashed by so many Americans and the media over the 
            building of an Islamic cultural center near Ground Zero.</p>

          <p>The collapse of journalistic standards finds its counterpart in the rise of civic
            illiteracy. An African American president certainly makes the Rush Limbaughs of
            the world even more irrational than they already are, just as the lunatic fringe
            seems to be able to define itself only through a mode of thought whose first 
            prin­ciple is to disclaim logic itself. But I think this dismissal is too easy. What 
            this decline in civility, the emergence of mob behavior, and the utter blurring in 
            the media between a truth and a lie suggest is that we have become one of the most 
            illiterate nations on the planet. I don't mean illiterate in the sense of not being 
            able to read, though we have far too many people who are functionally illiterate 
            in a so-called advanced democracy, a point that writers such as Chris Hedges, Susan 
            ]acoby, and the late Richard Hofstadter made clear in their informative books on 
            the rise of anti­-intellectualism in American life.<sup>2</sup> I am talking about a 
            different species of ignorance and anti-intellectualism. Illiterate in this instance 
            refers to the inability on the part of much of the American public to grasp private 
            troubles and the meaning of the self in relation to larger public problems and 
            social relations. It is a form of illiter­acy that points less to the lack of 
            technical skills and the absence of certain com­petencies than to a deficit in the 
            realms of politics. One that subverts both critical thinking and the notion of 
            literacy as both critical interpretation and the possibil­ity of intervention in the 
            world. This type of illiteracy is not only incapable of deal­ing with complex and 
            contested questions, it is also an excuse for glorifying the principle of self-
            interest as a paradigm for understanding politics. This is a form of illiteracy 
            marked by the inability to see outside of the realm of the privatized self; 
            an illiteracy in which the act of translation withers, reduced to a relic of 
            another age. The United States is a country that is increasingly defined by a 
            civic deficit, a chron­ic and deadly form of civic illiteracy that points to the 
            failure of both its education­al system and the growing ability of anti-democratic 
            forces to use the educational force of the culture to promote the new illiteracy. 
            As this widespread illiteracy has come to dominate American culture, we have moved 
            from a culture of questioning to a culture of shouting and in doing so have 
            restaged politics and power in both unproductive and anti-democratic ways.</p>

          <p>Think of the forces at work in the larger culture that work overtime to situate 
            us within a privatized world of fantasy, spectacle, and resentment that is entirely 
            removed from larger social problems and public concerns. For instance, corporate 
            culture with its unrelenting commercials carpet-bombs our audio and visual fields 
            with the message that the only viable way to define ourselves is to shop and con­sume 
            in an orgy of private pursuits. Popular culture traps us in the privatized uni­verse 
            of celebrity culture, urging us to define ourselves through the often empty and 
            trivialized and highly individualized interests of celebrities. Pharmaceutical 
            com­panies urge us to deal with our problems, largely produced by economic and 
            polit­ical forces out of our control, by taking a drug, one that will both chill us 
            out and increase their profit margins. (This has now become an educational measure 
            applied increasingly and indiscriminately to children in our schools.) Pop 
            psychologists urge us to simply think positively give each other hugs, and pull 
            ourselves up by the boot­straps while also insisting that those who confront reality 
            and its mix of complex social issues are, as Chris Hedges points out, defeatists, a 
            negative force that inhibits "our inner essence and power."<sup>3</sup> There is also 
            the culture of militarization, which per­meates all aspects of our lives from our 
            classrooms and the screen culture of real­ity television to the barrage of violent 
            video games and the blood letting in sports such as popular wrestling endlessly at 
            work in developing modes of masculinity that celebrate toughness, violence, cruelty, 
            moral indifference, and misogyny.</p>

          <p>All of these forces, whose educational influence should never be underestimat­ed, 
            constitute a new type of illiteracy, a kind of civic illiteracy in which it becomes 
            increasingly impossible to connect the everyday problems that people face with larg­er 
            social forces-thus depoliticizing their own sense of agency and making politics 
            itself an empty gesture. Is it any wonder that politics is now mediated through a 
            spectacle of anger, violence, humiliation, and rage that mimics the likes of Tbe Jerry 
            Springer Show? It is not that we have become a society of the spectacle-though that 
            is partly true-but that we have fallen prey to a new kind of illiteracy in which the 
            distinction between illusion and reality is lost, just as the ability to experience our 
            feelings of discontent, and our fears of uncertainty are reduced to private troubles, 
            paralyzing us in a sea of resentment waiting to be manipulated by extremists 
            extending from religious fanatics to right-wing radio hosts. This is a prescription 
            for a kind of rage that looks for easy answers, demands a heightened emotional 
            release, and resents any attempts to think through the connection between our 
            indi­vidual woes and any number of larger social forces. A short list of such forces 
            would include an unchecked system of finance, the anti-democratic power of the 
            corporate state, the rise of multinationals and the destruction of the manufacturing­ 
            base, and the privatization of public schooling along with its devaluing of 
            edu­cation as a public good. As the public collapses into the personal, the personal 
            becomes "the only politics there is, the only politics with a tangible referent or 
            emo­tional valence,"<sup>4</sup> the formative educational and political conditions 
            that make a democracy possible begin to disappear. Under such circumstances, the 
            language of the social is either devalued, pathologized, or ignored, and all dreams of 
            the future are now modeled around the narcissistic, privatized, and self-indulgent 
            needs of con­sumer and celebrity culture and the dictates of the allegedly free market. 
            How else to explain the rage against big government but barely a peep against the rule 
            of big corporations who increasingly control not only the government but almost every 
            vital aspect of our lives from health care to the quality of our environment?</p>

          <p>Stripped of its ethical and political importance, the public has been largely 
            reduced to a space where private interests are displayed, and the social order 
            increas­ingly mimics a giant Dx Pbil show where notions of the public register as simply a 
            conglomeration of private woes, tasks, conversations, and problems. Most impor­tantly, 
            as the very idea of the social collapses into an utterly privatized discourse, 
            everyday politics is decoupled from its democratic moorings, and it becomes more 
            difficult for people to develop a vocabulary for understanding how private problems 
            and public issues constitute the very lifeblood of a vibrant politics and democracy 
            itself This is worth repeating. Emptied of any substantial content, democracy 
            appears imperiled as individuals are unable to translate their privately suffered mis­ery 
            into genuine public debate, social concerns, and collective action. This is a 
            form of illiteracy that is no longer marginal to American society but is increasing­ly 
            becoming one of its defining and more frightening features.</p>

          <p>The raging narcissism that seems to shape every ad, film, television program, 
            and appeal now mediated through the power of the corporate state and consumer 
            society is not merely a clinical and individual problem. It is the basis for a new kind 
            of mass illiteracy that is endlessly reproduced through the venues of a number of 
            anti-democratic institutions and forces that eschew critical debate, self-reflection, 
            critical analysis, and certainly modes of dissent that call the totality of a society into 
            question. As American society becomes incapable of questioning itself the new 
            illit­eracy parades as just its opposite. We are told that education is about learning how 
            to take tests rather than learning how to think critically. We are told that anything 
            that does not make us feel good is not worth bothering with. We are told that char­acter 
            is the only measure of how to judge people who are the victims of larger social 
            forces that are mostly out of their control. When millions of people are unemployed, 
            tossed out of their homes, homeless, or living in poverty, the language of character, 
            pop psychology, consumerism, and celebrity culture are more than a diversion: 
            they are fundamental to the misdirected anger, mob rule, and illiteracy that frames 
            the screaming, racism, lack of civility, and often sheer and legitimate desperation.</p>

          <p>Authoritarianism is often abetted by an inability of the public to grasp how 
            questions of power, politics, history, and public consciousness are mediated at the
            interface of private issues and public concems. The ability to translate private 
            prob­lems into social considerations is fundamental to what it means to reactivate 
            polit­ical sensibilities and conceive of ourselves as critical citizens, engaged public 
            intel­lectuals, and social agents. Just as an obsession with the private is at odds 
            with a pol­itics informed by public consciousness, it also burdens politics by 
            stripping it of the kind of political imagination and collective hope necessary for a 
            viable notion of meaning, hope, and political agency.</p>

          <p>Civic literacy is about more than enlarging the realm of critique and affirming the 
            social. It is also about public responsibility, the struggle over democratic public 
            life, and the importance of critical education in a democratic society The U.S. 
            gov­ernment is more than willing to invest billions in wars, lead the world in arms 
            sales, and give trillions in tax cuts to the ultra-rich but barely acknowledges the 
            need to invest in those educational and civic institutionwfrom schools to the arts to 
            a mas­sive jobs creation program-that enable individuals to be border crossers, capable 
            of connecting the private and the public as part of a more vibrant understanding of 
            politics, identity, agency, and governance. The new illiteracy is not the cause of our 
            problems, which are deeply rooted in larger social, economic, and political forces that 
            have marked the emergence of the corporate state, a deadly form of racism parad­ing 
            as color blindness, and a ruthless market fundamentalism since the 1970s, but it is a 
            precondition for locking individuals into a system in which they are complic­itous in 
            their own exploitation, disposability, and potential death.</p>

          <p>The new illiteracy is about more than not knowing how to read the book or the word; 
            it is about not knowing how to read the world. The challenge it poses in a democracy 
            is one of both learning how to reclaim literacy so as to be able to narrate oneself 
            and the world from a position of agency. But it is also about unlearn­ing those modes 
            of learning that internalize modes of ignorance based on the concerted refusal to 
            know, be self-reflective, and act with principled dignity. It is a problem as serious 
            as any we have ever faced in the United States. At the core of any viable democratic 
            politics is the ability to question the assumptions central to an imagined democracy. 
            This is not merely a political issue but an educational issue, one that points to the 
            need for modes of civic education that provide the knowl­edge and competencies for 
            young and old alike to raise important questions about what education and literacy 
            itself should accomplish in a democracy.<sup>5</sup> This is not an issue we can 
            ignore too much longer.</p>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, echoing the feelings of 
            many progressives, in 2009 wrote in The New York Times about how dismayed 
            he was over the success that right-wing ideologues had in undercutting Obama's 
            health care bill-watering it down to a shadow of what it could have been before 
            it finally became law. He further indicated how unsettled he was by the ability of 
            conservatives to mobilize enormous public support against almost any reform 
            aimed at rolling back the economic, political, and social conditions that have 
            cre­ated the economic recession and the legacy of enormous suffering and hardship 
            for millions of Americans over the last thirty years.<sup>1</sup> Krugman is somewhat astonished 
            that after almost three decades the political scene is still under the sway of what he 
            calls the "zombie doctrine of Reaganism"-the notion that any action by govern­ment is 
            bad, except when it benefits the military, corporations, and thc rich. Clearly, 
            for Krugman, zombie Reaganism appears once again to be shaping policies under 
            the Obama regime.</p>

          <p>And yet, updated neoliberal Reaganism with its hatred of the social state, its 
            celebration of unbridled self-interest, its endless quest to privatize everything, and 
            its unflinching support for the deregulation of the economic system eventually 
            brought the country to economic near-collapse. It also produced enormous 
            suffer­ing for those who never benefited from the excesses of the second Gilded Age, 
            espe­cially unemployed and underemployed workers, the poor, disadvantaged minorities, 
            and eventually large segments of the middle class. And yet zombie politics or casi­no 
            capitalism is back fighting efforts to strengthen bank regulations, resisting caps on  
            CEO bonuses, preventing climate control legislation, and refusing to limit 
            mil­itary spending. Unlike other pundits, Krugman does not merely puzzle over how 
            zombie politics can keep turning up on the political scene, a return not unlike the 
            endless corpses who keep coming back to life in George Romero's 1968 classic film, 
            Night of the Living Dead (think of Bill Kristol, who seems to be wrong about every­ 
            thing but just keeps coming back like a character in a Romero film). Krugman takes 
            the reader beyond mere puzzlement and argues that a wacky and allegedly discred­ited 
            right-wing politics is far from dead. In fact, Krugman argues that one of the 
            great challenges of the current moment is to try to understand the conditions that 
            have allowed it to once again shape American politics and culture, given the enor­mous 
            problems, including the current recession, it has produced at all levels of 
            American society in the last thirty years.</p>

          <p>Part of the explanation for the enduring quality of such a destructive politics 
            can be found in the lethal combination of money power, and education that the right 
            wing has had a stranglehold on since the early 1970s. Financial power plus an 
            insightful understanding of the importance of cultural politics has allowed 
            conser­vatives to use their influence to develop an institutional infrastructure 
            and ideolog­ical apparatus to produce their own intellectuals, disseminate ideas, 
            and eventually control most of the commanding heights and institutions in which 
            knowledge is produced, circulated, and legitimated. This is not simply a story 
            about the rise of mean-spirited buffoons such as Glerm Beck, Bill O'Reill}g and 
            Michael Savage. Nor is it simply a story about the loss of language, a growing 
            anti-intellectualism in the larger culture, or the spread of what some have called 
            a new illiteracy endlessly being produced in popular culture. As important as these 
            tendencies are, there is some­ thing more at stake here that points to a combination 
            of power, money, and edu­cation in the service of creating an almost lethal restriction 
            on what can be heard, said, learned, and debated in the public sphere. And one 
            starting point for under­ standing this problem is what has been called the Powell 
            Memo-released on August 23, 1971-authored by Lewis F. Powell, who would later be 
            appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Powell sent the memo to the 
            U.S. Chamber of Commerce with the title "Attack on the American Free Enterprise 
            System."</p>

          <p>This memo is important because it reveals the power that conservatives attrib­uted 
            to the political nature of education and the significance this view had in shap­ing 
            the long-term strategy they put into place in the 1960s and 1970s to win an 
            ideological war against liberal intellectuals, who argued for holding government and 
            corporate power accountable as a precondition for extending and expanding the 
            promise of an inclusive democracy. The current concerted assault on government 
            and any other institutions not dominated by free-market principles represents the 
            high point of a fifty-year strategy that was first put into place by conservative 
            ide­ologues such as Frank Chodorov, the founder of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute; 
            publisher and author Wil.liam R Buckley; former Nixon Treasury Secretary William 
            Simon; and Michael ]oyce, the former head of both the Olin Foundation and the 
            Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. The Powell Memo is important because it 
            is the most succinct statement, if not the founding document, for establishing a 
            the­oretical framework and political blueprint for the current assault on any vestige of
            democratic public life that does not subordinate itself to the logic of the allegedly 
            free market.</p>

          <p>Initially, Powell identified the American college campus "as the single most 
            dynamic source" for producing and housing intellectuals "who are unsympathetic 
            to the [free] enterprise system."<sup>2</sup> He was particularly concerned about the 
            lack of conservatives in social sciences faculties and urged his supporters to use an 
            appeal to academic freedom as an opportunity to argue for "political balance" on 
            univer­sity campuses. Powell recognized that one crucial strategy in changing the 
            politi­cal composition of higher education was to convince university administrators 
            and boards of trustees that the most fundamental problem facing universities was "the 
            imbalance of many faculties."<sup>3</sup> Powell insisted that "the basic concepts of 
            balance, fairness and truth are difficult to resist, if properly presented to boards 
            of trustees, by writing and speaking, and by appeals to alumni associations and 
            groups."<sup>4</sup> But Powell was not only concerned about what he perceived as the 
            need to enlist high­er education as a bastion of conservative, free-market ideology.</p>
          <p>The Powell Memo was designed to develop a broad-based strategy both to counter 
            dissent and develop a material and ideological infiastructure with the capa­bility to 
            transform the American public consciousness through a conservative ped­agogical 
            commitment to reproduce the knowledge, values, ideology, and social relations of the 
            corporate state. For Powell, the war against liberalism and a substan­tive democracy 
            was primarily a pedagogical and political struggle designed both to win the hearts 
            and minds of the general public and to build a power base capable of eliminating 
            those public spaces, spheres, and institutions that nourish and sus­tain what Samuel 
            Huntington would later call (in a 1975 study on the "governabil­ity of democracies" 
            by the Trilateral Commission) an "excess of democracy."<sup>5</sup></p>

          <p>Central to such efforts was Powell's insistence that conservatives nourish a new 
              gen­eration of scholars who would inhabit the university and function as public 
            intel­lectuals actively shaping the direction of policy issues. He also advocated 
            the creation of a conservative speaker's bureau, staffed by scholars capable of 
            evaluat­ing "textbooks, especially in economics, political science and sociology."<sup>6</sup> 
            In addi­tion, he advocated organizing a corps of conservative public intellectuals 
            who would monitor the dominant media, publish their own scholarly journals, books, 
            and pamphlets, and invest in advertising campaigns to enlighten the American people
            on conservative issues and policies.</p>

          <p>The Powell Memo, while not the only influence, played an important role in 
            convincing a "cadre of ultraconservative and self-mythologizing millionaires bent 
            on rescuing the country from the hideous grasp of Satanic liberalism"<sup>7</sup> 
            to match their ideological fervor with their pocketbooks by "disbursing the collective 
            sum of roughly $3 billion over a period of thirty years in order to build a network of 
            pub­lic intellectuals, think tanks, advocacy groups, foundations, media outlets, and 
            pow­erful lobbying interests."<sup>8</sup> As Dave Johnson points out, the initial 
            effort was slow but effective:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>In 1973, in response to the Powell memo, Joseph Coors and Christian-right leader Paul 
            Weyrich founded the Heritage Foundation. Coors told Lee Edwards, historian of the 
            Heritage Foundation, that the Powell memo persuaded him that American business was 
            "ignoring a crisis." In response, Coors decided to help provide the seed fimding for 
            the cre­ation of what was to become the Heritage Foundation, giving $250,000. 
            Subsequently, the Olin Foundation, under the direction of its president, former 
            Treasury Secretary William Simon (author of the influential 1979 book A Time for 
            Truth), began funding similar orga­nizations in concert with "the Four Sisters"-
            Richard Mellon Scaife's various foundations, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, 
            the Olin Foundation and the Smith Richardson Foundation-along with Coors's 
            foundations, foundations associated with the Koch oil fam­ily, and a group of large 
            corporations.<sup>9</sup></p>

          <p>The most powerful members of this group were ]oseph Coors in Denver, Richard 
            Mellon Scaife in Pittsburgh, John Olin in New York City, David and Charles 
            Koch in Wichita, the Smith Richardson family in North Carolina, and Harry 
            Bradley in Milwaukee-all of whom agreed to finance a number of right-wing think 
            tanks, which over the past forty years have come to include the Lynde and Harry 
            Bradley Foundation, the Koch Foundation, the Castle Rock Foundation, and the 
            Sarah Scaife Foundation. This formidable alliance of far-right-wing foundations 
            deployed their resources in building and strategically linking "an impressive array 
            of almost 500 think tanks, centers, institutes and concerned citizens groups both 
            within and outside of the academy...." A small sampling of these entities includes 
            the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, the 
            Manhattan Institute, the Hoover Institution, the Claremont Institute, the American 
            Council of Trustees and Alumni, [the] Middle East Forum, Accuracy in Media, and 
            the National Association of Scholars, as well as [David] Horowitz's Center for the 
            Study of Popular Culture."<sup>10</sup></p>

          <p>For several decades, right-wing extremists have labored to put into place an ultra-
            conservative re-education machine-an apparatus for producing and dissem­inating a 
            public pedagogy in which everything tainted with the stamp of liberal ori­gin and the 
            word "public" would be contested and destroyed. Commenting on the rise of this vast 
            right-wing propaganda machine organized to promote the idea that democracy needs less 
            critical thought and more citizens whose only role is to consume, well-known author 
            Lewis Lapham writes:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The quickening construction of Santa's workshops outside the walls of government and the
            academy resulted in the increased production of pamphlets, histories, monographs, and 
            back­ground briefings intended to bring about the ruin of the liberal ideal in all its 
            institutional­ized forms-the demonization of the liberal press, the disparagement of 
            liberal sentiment, the destruction of liberal education-and by the time Ronald Reagan 
            arrived in triumph at the White House in 1980 the assembly lines were operating at 
            full capacity."<sup>11</sup></p>
        </blockquote>

          <p>Any attempt to understand and engage the current right-wing assault on all ves­tiges 
            of the social contract, the social state, and democracy itself will have to begin 
            with challenging this massive infrastructure, which functions as one of the most 
            powerful teaching machines we have seen in the United States, a teaching machine 
            that produces a culture that is increasingly poisonous and detrimental not just to 
            lib­eralism but to the formative culture that makes an aspiring democracy possible. The 
            presence of this ideological infrastructure extending from the media to other sites 
            of popular education suggests the need for a new kind of debate, one that is not 
            lim­ited to isolated issues such as health care, but is more broad based and 
            fundamen­tal, a debate about how power, inequality, and money constrict the educational, 
            economic, and political conditions that make democracy possible. The screaming 
            harpies and mindless anti-public "intellectuals" who dominate the media today are 
            not the problem: it is the conditions that give rise to the institutions that put them 
            in place, finance them, and drown out other voices. What must be clear is that this 
            threat to creating a critically informed citizenry is not merely about a crisis of 
            com­munication and language but also about the ways in which money and power 
            cre­ate the educational conditions that make a mockery out of debate while hijacking 
            any trace of democracy.</p>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>The bitter debate that unfolded over Obama's health care plan garnered a great deal 
            of media attention. The images were both familiar and disturbing-members of 
            Congress being shouted down, taunted, hanged in efligy, and in some instances 
            receiving death threats. In some cases, mob scenes produced violence and resulted 
            in a number of arrests. Increasingly, people were showing up with guns at these 
            meetings, revealing an intimate connection between an embrace of violence, pol­itics, 
            and a disturbing hatred of both the public sphere and the conditions for real 
            exchange, debate, and dialogue over important social issues. Rowdy, zombie-like 
            crowds, many of whom read from talking points made available to them by right­ 
            wing groups and legitimated by conservative television pundits, embraced a poli­tics 
            reminiscent of the Brown Shirts, whose task in Germany in the 1930s was to 
            disrupt oppositional meetings, beat up opponents of the Nazi or Fascist Parties, and 
            intimidate those individuals and groups that criticized authoritarian ideology.<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>This is not meant to suggest that all of the protestors at these meetings were 
            members of extremist groups as much as it seeks to reveal the deep historical 
            affinity such mob tactics have with dangerous authoritarian tendencies, many of 
            which are irresponsibly sanctioned both by politicians such as Republican Senator 
            Tom Coburn and right-wing television hosts such as Glenn Beck and Sean 
            Hannity of course, what started out as random meetings soon became a 
            coordi­nated attempt to build an organized political machine, which has mushroomed 
            into what has been called the Tea Party movement?<sup>2</sup> The United States is 
            neither Nazi Germany nor fascist Italy. What is important to recognize in light of 
            these violent tendencies in the culture is Hannah Arendt's prescient warning that 
            elements of totalitarianism continue to be with us and that rather than being 
            relegated to the dustbin of history, the "still existing elements of totalitarianism 
            would be more like­ly to crystallize into new forms."<sup>3</sup> These tendencies 
            have been around for the last twenty years in the form of militarism, religious 
            fundamentalism, a rabid Economic Darwinism, and a growing violence against the poor, 
            immigrants, dissenters, and others marginalized because of their age, gender, race, 
            ethnicity, and color.</p>

          <p>What is new under the Obama regime is that the often hidden alliance between 
            corporate power and the forces of extremism is now both celebrated and highly vis­ible 
            in the culture. What is novel is that the production of symbolic violence and 
            the organized attempts to undermine the most basic principles of democracy are now 
            embraced, if not showcased, as a register of patriotism and fueled by talk-radio 
            extremists and the Rupert Murdoch media empire. For example, Fox News' Glenn 
            Beck mixes his anti-govermnent diatribes with the language of radical militia 
            groups. Beck has warned President Obama that "The second American revolution 
            is being played out right now . . . what is ahead may loosen the bonds of society," 
            and it may end with "a French Revolution." Endlessly capitalizing upon fear and 
            insecurity, Beck warns his audience that "[I]f we don't have some common sense, 
            we're facing the destruction of our country _ _ . it's coming."<sup>4</sup> Eric 
            Boehlert gets it right in claiming that what we are currently "witnessing is a 
            militia rerun. Except this time, thanks to the likes of Beck and Fox News, the 
            unwanted repeat is being broadcast nationwide."<sup>5</sup> Increasingly, politics 
            is being emptied of any substance as citizens are reduced to obedient recipients of 
            power by both the dominant media and by a number of politicians at the highest level 
            of government. Shaming and silencing those who are at odds with right-wing and 
            corporate views of the world have become a national pastime or, as the Fox News 
            pundits would argue, just a mat­ter of common sense.</p>

          <p>Some have referred to these groups as mobs, but that distinction does not hold 
            since many of the protesters are being fed talking points and are well organized to 
            target very specific Democratic Congressional representatives and increasingly any 
            currently elected politician. Mob rule is often spontaneous, while these rowdy, 
            gun-toting, and increasingly violent groups are being organized and legitimated 
            through the money and power of the insurance industry, lobbying groups such as 
            FreedomWorks, anti-government politicians, racist fringe groups, and elements of 
            the white militia. Many of them echo the type of anti-government extremism 
            reminiscent of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma bomber. As Frank Rich points out,</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Anyone who was cognizant during the McVeigh firestorm would recognize the old 
            warn­ing signs re-emerging from the mists of history. The Patriot movement. "The New World 
            Order," with its shadowy conspiracies hatched by the Council on Foreign Relations and the 
            Trilateral Commission... White supremacists. Militias ... [and what] the Southern 
            Poverty Law Center had found in its report last year: the unhinged and sometimes armed 
            anti-government right that was thought to have vaporized after its Oklahoma apotheosis is 
            making a comeback. And now it is finding common cause with some elements of the 
            diverse, far-flung and still inchoate Tea Party movement. All it takes is a few self-styled 
            "patri­ots" to sow havoc.<sup>6</sup></p>

          <p>This is a movement of older white Americans who are generally uninformed polit­ically, 
            eager to eliminate most government agencies, and harbor an acute disdain for 
            debate, thoughtfulness, and dialogue. There is a chilling similarity between their 
            hatred of government and McVeigh's claim that "I reached the decision to go on 
            the offensive-to put a check on government abuse of power."<sup>7</sup> In other words, they 
            hate and even view as a pathology any vestige of democratic governance, politics, 
            and representation. They are part of a fringe element within the GOP that has 
            moved increasingly from the margins to the center of power.<sup>8</sup> They have already 
            played a prominent role in electing Scott Brown from Massachusetts to the U.S. 
            Senate, enabled Rand Paul, a card-carrying Tea Party founder, to win the Kentucky 
            Republican senatorial primary, and successfully ran a number of candidates for pub­lic 
            office.</p>

          <p>While the media have often focussed, if not cashed in, on the rowdiness of Tea 
            Party members, they have been represented largely as simply angry citizens with 
            another point of view, as opposed to being members of a deeply authoritarian cam­paign 
            to both disrupt Obama's reform agenda and to gut and destroy those spaces 
            in American society where democracy can be nourished. Such attempts at balance 
            undermine serious reporting and are politically disingenuous. Such groups have to 
            be understood as being organized not merely for the production of symbolic and real 
            violence, but also as a growing extremist movement that promotes a wilful mis­reading 
            of the meaning of freedom, security, and human rights. What is crucial to 
            recognize is that the groups who were shouting out and disrupting health care meet­ings 
            are also the same people who Want to privatize and corporatize public school­ing, 
            eliminate all traces of the social state, and destroy all remnants of those public 
            spheres that promote critical literacy, civic courage, and non-commodiiied values 
            that give meaning to a democracy.</p>

          <p>These are the folks who encouraged members of the Florida legislature to pass 
            a law that outlawed historical interpretation in Florida public schools.<sup>9</sup> These are 
            the same groups for whom any vestige of education that promotes critical agency, 
            self-representation, and promotes democracy is condemned-or worse, simply dis­patched 
            to the garbage can of educational practices. They are deeply xenophobic and 
            appear to support fully Arizona's reactionary anti-immigrant bill. It is impossible 
            to understand what these groups represent unless they are seen as part of an author­itarian 
            tradition that has gained enormous strength in the last twenty years as part 
            of a broader effort to corporatize civil society, militarize everyday life, criminalize
            the effects of social problems, privatize public goods, eviscerate any viable notion 
            of the social, govern society through the laws of the marketplace, and destroy those 
            public spaces where norms and democratic values are produced and constantly renewed.</p>

          <p>Viewed primarily as either an economic investment or with unadulterated dis­dain, 
            the public sphere is being undermined as a central democratic space for fos­tering 
            the citizen-based processes of deliberation, debate, and dialogue. The 
            important notion that space can be used to cultivate citizenship is now trans­formed 
            by a new "common sense" that links it almost entirely to the production of 
            consumers or to a pathologized space that bears the imprint of immigrants and those 
            others now viewed with contempt by the nativism of right-wing groups and their 
            televised spokespersons. The inevitable correlate to this logic is that providing 
            space for democracy to grow is no longer a priority. As theorists such as Jurgen 
            Habermas and David Harvey have argued, the idea of critical citizenship cannot 
            flourish without the reality of public space.<sup>10</sup> Put differently, "the space of 
            citizen­ship is as important as the idea of citizenship.</p>

          <p>As a political category, space is crucial to any critical understanding of how 
            power circulates, how disciplinary practices are constructed, and how social control 
            is organized. Public space as a political category performs invaluable theoretical work 
            in connecting ideas to material struggles, theories to concrete practices, and polit­ical 
            operations to the concerns of everyday life. Without public space, it becomes 
            more difficult for individuals to imagine themselves as political agents or to under­stand 
            the necessity for developing a discourse capable of defending civic institutions. 
            Public space confirms the idea of individuals and groups having a public voice, thus 
            drawing a distinction between civic liberty and market liberty.<sup>11</sup></p>

          <p>The demands of citizenship affirm the social as a political concept in opposi­tion 
            to its conceptualization as a strictly economic category. The sanctity of the tra­ditional 
            town hall or public square in American life is grounded in the crucial 
            recognition that citizenship has to be cultivated in non-commercialized spaces, 
            informed by non-commercial civic values. Such spaces mark both the importance 
            of the public and the need for spheres where dialogue, debate, and reason prevail 
            against the production of civic illiteracy, violence, and mob rule. Indeed, 
            democra­cy itself needs public spheres where critical education as a condition for 
            democra­cy can be renewed, where people can meet, and democratic identities, values, and 
            relations have the time "to grow and flourish."<sup>12</sup> The organized disruptions of 
            town meetings, coupled with a growing Tea Party movement that appears to har­bor more 
            hate than insight, should not cancel out but renew the historical impor­tance of 
            public spaces. Such spaces are crucial for nourishing civic discourses and offering 
            counter-movements to fight the current disappearance of democratic pub­ic
            spheres as significant spaces in which powerful states, corporations, groups, and
            individuals can be held directly accountable for the ethical and material effects of
            their decisions.</p>

          <p>The hostile town meetings we witnessed in 2009 and 2010 are symptomatic of
            a growing authoritarianism in the United States, mobilized through an ongoing cul­ture 
            of fear and a form of patriotic correctness designed to bolster a rampant 
            nationalism and a selective popularism. One consequence of such a move is the 
            demise of the promise of a vibrant democracy and the corresponding impoverish­ment 
            of political life, increasingly manifested in the inability of a society to ques­tion 
            itself, engage in critical dialogue, and translate private problems into social 
            issues. This is a position that both characterizes and threatens any viable notion of 
            democracy in the United States in the current historical moment. In a post-9/11 world, 
            the space of shared responsibility has given way to the space of private fears 
            and larger corporate interests. Politics is now mediated through a spectacle of mobrule 
            in which fear and violence become the only modalities through which to grasp 
            the meaning of the self and larger social relations. As the public collapses into high­ly 
            charged narratives of personal anger, reason is uncoupled from freedom and the 
            triumph of civic illiteracy, suggesting that irrational mob rule becomes "the only 
            pol­itics there is, the only politics with a tangible referent or emotional valence."<sup>13</sup></p>

          <p>Stripped of its ethical and political importance, the public has been largely
            reduced to a space where private interests are displayed, and the social order increas­ingly 
            mimics a giant reality TV show where notions of the public register as sim­ply a 
            conglomeration of private woes, violent outbursts, and an unchecked hatred
            for dissent and dialogue. Most importantly, as everyday politics is decoupled from
            its democratic moorings, it becomes more difficult for people to develop a vocab­ulary 
            for understanding how private problems and public issues constitute the very
            lifeblood of a vibrant politics and democracy itself Emptied of any substantial con­tent, 
            democracy appears imperiled as individuals are unable to translate their pri­vately 
            suffered misery into public concerns and collective action.</p>

          <p>As the social is devalued and public discourse and politics disappear, only to be 
            replaced by unruly mobs emboldened by right-wing celebrities and politicians "to 
            become part of the mob," "shout out," and "rattle" speakers, what emerges is not sim­ply 
            an ugly display of individuals and groups mobilized by lobbyist-run groups such 
            as FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity. On the contrary, more than healthcare 
            reform is under attack. What is truly under attack is any artifact of a democ­ratic 
            society that is at odds with a free-market fundamentalism and the dominant 
            financial and economic interests that benefit from it.</p>

          <p>Politics takes many forms, but central to it is the need for individuals, groups,
            and social movements to be able to translate individual problems into public con­cerns, 
            to have informed opinions, and to create spaces where power is held account­able. 
            The town hall fiascos are important, but they are only symptomatic of a larg­er 
            assault against the social contract, the social state, public spheres, and democra­tic 
            governance. And when read in this context, the challenge presented by these
            manufactured spectacles can be used to raise the level of the analysis and public 
            con­versation about the historical, economic, and political context which has nourished 
            them and what must be done to address the larger threat and problems they pose 
            to American democracy. Clearly, any response to such outbursts and threats posed 
            by the growing Tea Party movement must be seen as part of a broader eH`ort to
            address the importance of critical education, civic literacy, social responsibility, as
            well as the need to raise important questions about what education and civic liter­acy 
            should accomplish in a democracy and what might such a politics capable of tak­ing 
            up this challenge look like.</p>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>This is a difficult time in American history. Economic meltdowns, massive
            unemployment, corporate-induced ecological disasters in the Gulf of Mexico,
            and a growing disdain for liberal and progressive politics that has gained enormous
            currency since the election of Barack Obama to the presidency. The American peo­ple 
            have every right to demand to live in peace, enjoy the comforts of economic 
            security, have access to decent health care, be able to send their children to 
            quali­ty schools, and live with a measure of security. Yet at a time when public values are 
            subordinated to the rationality of profits, exchange values, and unbridled self­ 
            interest, politics becomes corrupt, devoid of critical agents, and reduced to empty 
            rituals largely orchestrated by those who control the wealth, income, media, and 
            commanding institutions of American society. As we have just witnessed in the 
            debate on health care reform, the interests of the vast majority of American peo­ple 
            in a public option and the extension of Medicare have been totally lost on a 
            Congress that has been corrupted by power and its comfortable and shameful 
            relations with those who control the military-industrial-academic complex. The 
            Republican Party minority in the Senate did everything they could to prevent the 
            further lengthening of a six-month extension of emergency jobless benefits for the 
            millions of long-term unemployed Americans, many of whom are barely able to 
            sur­vive and have given up all hope. Such tactics once again proving that at the 
            core of their policies is a desire to sap every element of life out of any viable 
            notion of the social state.</p>

          <p>Public values, public spheres, and the notion of the common good are viewed 
            by too many politicians as either a hindrance to the goals of a market-driven soci­ety, 
            or they are simply treated as a burden on the society, viewed as a sign of weak­ness, 
            if not a pathology. Ethical considerations and social responsibility are now
            devalued, if not disdained, in a society wedded to short-term investments, easy 
            prof­its, and a mode of economics in which social costs are increasingly borne by 
            the poor while financial and political benefits are reaped by the rich. Unchecked 
            self-inter­est and ruthless, if not trivial, modes of competition now replace politics 
            or at least become the foundation for politics as complex issues are reduced to 
            friend/enemy, winner/loser dichotomies. The crass Social Darwinism played out on 
            reality TV now finds its counterpart in the politics of both the Democratic and 
            Republican Parties.</p>

          <p>For instance, the Republican Party's only identifying ideology is that it is against 
            anything that supports the common good and undercuts the profits of corporations 
            and the rich. At the same time, Democrats have given up any vestige of a progres­sive 
            politics and vision, aligning their ideals to conform to the interests of the 
            lob­byists who now represent the not-so-invisible shadow government.<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>Instead of public spheres that promote dialogue, debate, and arguments with 
            supporting evidence, we have a national entertainment state with its multiple 
            pub­lic and private spheres that infantilizes almost everything it touches, while offering 
            opinions that utterly disregard evidence, truth, and civility.<sup>2</sup> Politics has come 
            under the sway of multiple forms of fundamentalism, becoming more militarized, 
            privatized, and divorced from any notion of the common good or public welfare.</p>

          <p>Violence saturates the culture, a brutalizing masculinity fuels the militarization of 
            everyday life, and a collective ignorance is fueled by the assumption that intelligence 
            and thoughtfulness should be dismissed as a form of elitism. Populism, or at least 
            the Sarah Palin version, has little resemblance to genuine resistance to the 
            anti­democratic tendencies in American society and now plays out as a homage to 
            illit­eracy and stupidity. Screen culture in its many manifestations signals if not 
            celebrates the collapse of politics and the coming apocalypse. Making the world a 
            better place has given way to collective narratives about how to survive alone in 
            a world whose destruction is just a matter of time. Death, fear, and insecurity 
            trump cru­cial questions about what it means to apprehend the conditions to live a 
            good life in common with others. Not only is the issue of the good life and the 
            conditions that make it possible often lost in the babble of the infotainment 
            state, but the mar­ket values that produced the economic crisis have so devalued 
            the concept and prac­tice of democracy that Americans find it hard to even define 
            its meaning outside of the sham of money-driven elections and the freedom to shop.</p>

          <p>In the last decade (2000-2010), the representative functions of democracy have not only taken 
            a steep dive in light of a political system whose policies are shaped by powerful 
            cor­porations and the imperatives of the rich but also made largely dysfunctional 
            because of a morally and politically bankrupt electoral system intimately tied to 
            wealth and power. The dominant media largely function as a form of moral anes­thesia 
            and political firewall that legitimates a ruthless and failed free-market sys­tem 
            while refusing to make visible the workings of a casino capitalism that rejects 
            as a weakness any measure of compassion, care, trust, and vulnerability. As the 
            val­ues and interests of the market become a template for all of society, the only  
            insti­tutions, social relations, public spheres, and modes of agency that matter are those 
            that pay homage to the rule of mobile capital and the interests of financial titans.</p>

          <p>What the current financial crisis (2008) has revealed has less to do with the so-called 
            greed of Wall Street moguls than with the increasing fragility of a market-driven 
            system that produces inequalities in every sphere of life, making its ode to 
            democ­racy and the good life a dishonest fiction. Moreover, the formative 
            culture that legitimates market fundamentalism and market democracy does more 
            than erase any trace of self-regulation and public accountability; it also 
            eliminates the language of self-reflection along with any form of productive 
            discourse about the common good, public welfare, and the conditions that make 
            all life worth living. Market-dri­ven culture rejects the assumption that freedom 
            is a shared experience in which self­ interest is subordinated to the affirmation 
            of public values, the common good, and the notion of social responsibility implied 
            in recognizing and transforming the con­ditions that make the lives of others 
            precarious. As Judith Butler masterfully puts it:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Precariousness implies living socially, that is, the fact that one's life is 
            always in some sense in the hands of the other. It implies exposure both to those 
            we know and to those we do not know; a dependency on people we know, or barely know, 
            or know not at all. Reciprocally, it implies being impinged upon by the exposure and 
            dependency of others, most of whom remain anonymous. These are not necessarily relations 
            of love or even of care, but consti­tute obligations toward others, most of whom we 
            cannot name and do not know, and who may or may not bear traits of familiarity to an 
            established sense of who "we" are. ln the inter­est of speaking in common parlance, we 
            could say that "we" have such obligations to "oth­ers" and presume that we know who "we" 
            are in such an instance. The social implication of this view, however, is precisely 
            that the "we" does not, and cannot, recognize itself; that it is riven from the start, 
            interrupted by alterity, as Levinas has said, and the obligations "we" have are precisely 
            those that disrupt any established notion of thc "we."<sup>3</sup></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>We have lived through two decades in which the call for security has lost any semblance 
            of truth and political necessity and has become the legitimating code for imposing 
            on the American people an imperial presidency-especially under Donald J. Trump, but growing 
            precipously under George W. Bush and even under Obama-undermined crucial civil liberties, 
            and expanded the violence and terrorism associated with a permanent war economy and culture.
            Democracy thrives on dissent, but dissent and critical citizenship cannot take place 
            in a country marked by a widening gap between political democracy and 
            socio-eco­nomic power. Inequality is not just a normal outgrowth of a market-driven 
            econ­omy; it is fundamental to a political system that destroys democracy. A country that 
            allows the power of multi-national corporations to be exempt from rule of demo­cratic 
            law and the responsible demands of a democracy has already lost the battle between 
            balancing civil liberties and national security any call for further giving 
            up of civil liberties suggests a dangerous silence about the degree to which civil 
            lib­erties are already at risk and how the current call for national safety might work 
            to further a different type of terrorism, one not marked by bombs and explosions, but 
            by state-supported repression, the elimination of dissent, and the death of both the 
            reality and promise of democracy.</p>

          <p>At this time of national crisis, we need to recognize that the current econom­ic 
            recession cannot be understood apart from the crisis of democracy itself lt is all 
            the more crucial, therefore, to recognize in a post~Gi1ded Age moment that those 
            public spaces that traditionally have offered forums for debating norms, critically 
            engaging ideas, making private issues public, and evaluating judgments are 
            disap­pearing under the juggernaut of free-market values, corporate power, and intense 
            lobbying pressure on the part of the country's most powerful financial institutions. 
            Schools, universities, the media, and other aspects of the cultural education 
            appa­ratus are being increasingly privatized or corporatized and removed from the 
            dis­course of the public good. Consequently, it becomes all the more crucial for 
            educators, parents, social movements, and others to raise fundamental questions 
            about what it means to revitalize a politics and ethics that takes seriously "such 
            val­ues as citizen participation, the public good, political obligation, social 
            governance, and community."</p>

          <p>The call for a revitalized politics grounded in an effective democracy substan­tively 
            challenges the dystopian practices of the new culture of fear and neoliberal­ism-
            with their all-consuming emphasis on insecurity, market relations, 
            commercialization, privatization, and the creation of a world-wide economy of 
            part-time workers-against their utopian promises. Such an intervention con­fronts 
            Americans with the problem as well as challenge of developing those pub­lic 
            spheres-such as the media, higher education, and other cultural 
            institutions-that provide the conditions for creating citizens who are capable of 
            exercising their freedoms, competent to question the basic assumptions that gov­ern 
            political life, and skilled enough to participate in developing broad social 
            move­ments that will enable them to shape the basic social, political, and economic 
            orders that govem their lives.</p>

          <p>In spite of the fact that some notions of the public good have been recalled from 
            exile in light of the economic recession and the election of Barack Obama, many 
            young people and adults today still view the private as the only space in which to 
            imagine any sense of hope, pleasure, or possibility. Not only is hope disappearing 
            for this generation-which has been asked to give more but ask for less-but the 
            economic and educational conditions that enable any sense of possibility for this 
            generation are quickly disappearing. And while Obama and his priests of high 
            finance have spent billions to bail out banks and conduct foreign wars, they have 
            refused to implement an adequate jobs-creation program for young people and the 
            millions of unemployed.</p>

          <p>Market forces continue to focus on the related issues of consumption, exces­sive 
            profits, and fear. Reduced to the act of consuming, citizenship is "mostly about 
            forgetting, not learning,"<sup>5</sup> in spite of the hyped-up and increasing appeal to bear­ing 
            the burden collectively of hard times-a burden that always falls on the shoul­ders of 
            working people but not the banks or other commanding financial institutions. How 
            else to explain the 2010 record profits of big banks and invest­ment houses in the 
            midst of an unflinching recession while millions lose their 
            homes, jobs, and dignity? Moreover, as social visions of equity and justice recede 
            from public memory, unfettered, brutal self-interests combine with retrograde 
            social policies to make security and safety a top domestic priority. One conse­quence 
            is that all levels of government are being hollowed out, reducing their role 
            to dismantling the gains of the welfare state as they increasingly construct policies 
            that now criminalize social problems, sell off public goods to the highest corporate 
            bidders, and prioritize penal methods over social investments. Increasingly, notions 
            of the public cease to resonate as a site of utopian possibility, as a fundamental space 
            for how we reactivate our political sensibilities and conceive of ourselves as critical 
            citizens, engaged public intellectuals, and social agents.</p>

          <p>The growing lack of justice in American society rises in proportion to the lack 
            of political imagination and collective hope.<sup>6</sup> We live at a time when the forces and 
            advocates of a market-driven fundamentalism and militarism not only undermine 
            all attempts to revive the culture of politics as an ethical response to the demise of 
            democratic public life but also aggressively wage a war against the very possibility 
            of creating non-commodified public spheres and forums that provide the conditions 
            for critical education, link learning to social change, political agency to the defense 
            of public goods, and intellectual courage to the refusal to surrender knowledge to 
            the highest bidder. Understood as both a set of economic policies and an impover­ished 
            notion of citizenship, neoliberalism represents not just a series of market-dri­ven 
            programs but also a coherent set of cultural, political, and educational practices 
            that mobilize communities around shared fears and collective insecurities.</p>

          <p>Unlike some theorists who suggest that politics as a site of contestation, criti­cal 
            exchange, and engagement has either come to an end or is in a state of termi­nal arrest 
            in light of the current calls for patriotic unity, I believe that the current depressing 
            state of politics points to the urgent challenge of reformulating the cri­sis of 
            democracy as part of a fiindamental crisis of vision, meaning, education, and 
            political agency Politics devoid of a democratic vision either degenerates into 
            cyn­icism or appropriates a view of power that appears to be equated only with domi­nation. 
            Lost from such accounts is the recognition that democracy has to be struggled over-even 
            in the face of a most appalling crisis of political agency and threats to national 
            security. There is also little attention paid to the fact that the 
            struggle over politics and democracy is inextricably linked to creating public spheres 
            where individuals can be educated as political agents equipped with the skills, 
            capacities, and knowledge they need not only to actually perform as autonomous 
            political agents but also to believe that such struggles are worth taking up. Central 
            here is the assumption that politics is not simply about power but also, as the 
            philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis points out, "has to do with political judgments 
            and value choices,"<sup>7</sup> indicating that questions of civic education-learning how to 
            become a skilled citizen-are central to both the struggle over political agency and 
            democracy itself Finally, there is the widespread refusal among many Americans 
            and educators to recognize that the issue of civic education-with its emphasis on 
            critical thinking, bridging the gap between learning and everyday life, understand­ing 
            the connection between power and knowledge, and using the resources of his­tory  
            to extend democratic rights and identities-is not only the foundation for 
            expanding and enabling political agency but that such education takes place across 
            a wide variety of public spheres through the very force of culture itself.</p>

          in the Age of<br>
          Casino Capitalism, iv</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Any democratically inspired understanding of politics must challenge a casino 
            politics that fills the social order and the sphere of politics with the walking dead.
            While the conditions for challenging casino politics may be under assault in what 
            might be called a progressive administration, the basis for expanding and deepen­ing 
            democracy must be part of an ongoing struggle of engaged critique, civic 
            courage, and organized collective struggles. Critical knowledge grounded in press­ing 
            social problems offers individuals and groups an important resource for shap­ing the 
            conditions that bear down on their lives, enabling them to resist those forces 
            that want to narrow the meaning of political freedom and social citizenship. The 
            production of such knowledge must be connected to the urgent call to revitalize the 
            language of civic education and ethical imagination as part of a broader discourse 
            of political agency and critical citizenship in a global world.</p>

          <p>Reclaiming the connection between the political and the ethical imagination 
            as a pedagogical act may be one of the most crucial challenges facing the American 
            public in the twenty-first century If the institutions and conditions for a critical 
            for­mative culture of questioning and civic engagement necessary for thinking beyond 
            the narrow framing mechanisms of casino capitalism, militarism, and religious 
            fundamentalism do not come into play, it is conceivable that the current econom­ic 
            recession will be repeated within a few short years, and American society will slip 
            into a form of authoritarianism that will give up even its most dubious claims on 
            democracy. The current crisis has systemic and ideological origins, and both must 
            be addressed through a new political language in which ethical imagination cou­ples  
            with a sense of educated hope and the need for collective agents willing to build 
            alternative public spheres and viable critical social movements.</p>

          <p>We currently live in a society controlled by political and economic zombies. 
            Under such circumstances, the coupling of cynicism and multiple forms of illiter­acy 
            undermines the possibility of critical thought, agency, and action. Public val­ues 
            or the public good, when they are invoked, are often couched in a nostalgic
            discourse about the New Deal or the Great Society Rather than being viewed as a
            legacy that needs to be reclaimed, re-imagined, and renewed, visions of the public
            good and the public values they embody are sequestered to the historical past, put
            on display like a museum piece that is worth viewing but not an ideal worth 
            strug­gling over. Corporate domination, power, abuse, and greed are once again being
            legitimated and argued for by a variety of right-wing movements in the United
            States, the most visible being the Tea Party movement. These movements do more
            than preach about God, money, and guns; they also sabotage democracy, block pub­lic 
            debate about alternative forms of power, and try to sell the illusion, as Chris 
            Hedges points out, "that the free market [is] a natural outgrowth of democracy and 
            a force of nature" that we simply have to accept unquestionably.<sup>8</sup> Without an 
            urgent reconsideration of the crucial place of public values in shaping American 
            soci­ety, the meaning and gains of the past that extend fiom the Civil Rights movement 
            to the antiwar movements of the 1960s will be lost, offering neither models nor 
            examples of struggles forged in the heat of reclaiming democratic values, relations, 
            and institutions.</p>

          <p><i>New York Times</i> columnist Frank Rich has argued that the most striking 
            char­acteristic of the last decade is how much the American people have been conned, 
            played for suckers with arguments about weapons of mass destruction, the genius 
            of Karl Rove, and the importance of corporations in shaping our lives, to name a 
            few of the lies.<sup>9</sup> Actually, as insightful as Rich is, he gets it backward. His claim that the American public has been fed a massive diet of illusions enabling a big con over­ 
            looks the power these ideas or deliberately shaped cons have as part of an official 
            and legitimating ideology. These ideas are not illusions; they are the symbolic 
            extensions of real and systemic power relations, and the often commonsense views 
            they promote are powerful modes of legitimation. The issue that needs to be 
            addressed is not simply about recognizing illusions but dismantling the 
            socio-eco­nomic-educational forces that produce and circulate them as part of a 
            larger liam­ing of distinct and systemic power relations. If we are to reclaim any 
            viable notion of the political along with the public values that give it meaning, 
            we must address the primacy of pedagogy and critical inquiry as part of a broader 
            attempt to revi­talize the conditions for individual and social agency, while 
            simultaneously address­ing the most basic problems facing the prospects for social 
            justice and global democracy. Public values matter, and they must become part of 
            any ongoing attempt to give meaning to politics, the ethical imagination, and the 
            promise of an aspir­ing democracy.</p>

          Zombie Politics</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>By almost any political, economic, and ethical measure, Barack Obama's 
            elec­tion victory in 2008 inherited a set of problems produced by one of the dark­est 
            periods in American history.<sup>1</sup> In the eight years prior to 0bama's presidency 
            not only did the spaces where genuine politics could occur largely disappear as a 
            result of an ongoing assault by the market-driven forces of privatization, 
            deregu­lation, and unrestrained corporate power, but there was also a radical 
            hardening of the culture that increasingly disparaged democratic values, the 
            public good, and human dignity-and with these the safety nets provided by a 
            once-robust but now exiled social state. George W. Bush, the privileged and 
            profligate son of a wealthy Texas oilman, became the embodiment of a political 
            era in which willful immatu­rity and stubborn civic illiteracy found its match in 
            an emerging culture of excess and irresponsibility.<sup>2</sup> As thc age of casino 
            capital reigned supreme over American society, the ongoing work of 
            democratization-along with the public spheres need­ed to sustain it-became an 
            increasingly fragile, perhaps even dysfunctional, pro­ject. Market principles 
            now reached far beyond the realm of the economic and played a formative role 
            in influencing and organizing every domain of human activ­ity and interaction, 
            while simultaneously launching a frontal attack on notions of a common good, 
            public purpose, non-commodified values, and democratic modes of governing.</p>

          <p>Yet even in the aftermath of the October 2008 global financial crisis and the 
            historic election of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States, the 
            vocabulary and influence of corporate power and hapless governance can still be 
            heard as the expansion of market fundamentalism continues, albeit more slowly, 
            along the trajectory of privileging corporate interests over the needs of the public 
            good, ignoring the rising demands of millions of people struggling for economic, 
            racial, and political justice. Tragically, the Obama administration seems complicit 
            with what has become an element of common sense for a large and noisy segment 
            of the populace-that the market, rather than politics, gives people what they 
            want. President Obama does not talk about a much-needed jobs-creation program 
            to address the massive hardships and suffering many people are experiencing. 
            Instead, he gets his cues from Wall Street and now focuses on taming the budget 
            deficit.<sup>3</sup> Nor does he talk about the crippling poverty, collapsing urban 
            infrastruc­tures, or the general despair that now grips the country, this state of 
            affairs suggests not only a perilous future for the social state and a government 
            willing to intervene on behalf of its citizens but also a dangerous view of 
            govemance in which econom­ic priorities dominate and suppress important social 
            needs rather than being care­fully adjusted toward the goal of fostering a more 
            just, more democratic society.</p>

          <p>It appears ever more unlikely that the Obama administration will undo the 
            havoc wrought by the Bush administration (itself the culmination of a decades-long 
            trend toward market deregulation) or reverse the effects of a rampant free-market 
            fixndamentalism now unleashed across the globe. As the financial crisis looms large 
            in the lives of the majority of Americans, government Hinds are used to bail out Wall 
            Street bankers rather than being used to address either the growing impoverishment 
            of the many people who have lost homes, jobs, and hope of a better future or the 
            structural conditions that created such problems. In this scenario, a privileged 
            minority retains the freedom to purchase time, goods, services, and security, while 
            the vast majority of people are relegated to a life without protections, benefits, and 
            safety supports. For those populations considered expendable, redundant, and 
            invis­ible by virtue of their race, class, and age, life becomes increasingly 
            precarious.</p>

          <p>As I have mentioned throughout this book, youth, in particular, are assaulted 
            by market forces that commodify almost every aspect of their lives, though 
            differ­ent groups of young people bear unequally the burden of this market-driven 
            assault. Those who are marginalized by class and power suffer more than the 
            indignity of being endlessly commodified and commercially carpet-bombed. They 
            are also objects of a low-intensity war that now criminalizes their behavior, 
            subjects increas­ing aspects of their lives to harsh disciplinary practices, and 
            treats them as both dan­gerous and disposable. In a society in which the social 
            state that has been hollowed out and largely stripped of its welfare functions, youth 
            are no longer provided with the economic, social, and cultural supports that offer 
            them dignity, prosperity, and the promise of a better fiiture. Instead, they are 
            now largely governed by a corpo­rate state that "secures power through the imposition 
            of law, discipline and uncom­promising modes of punishment and imprisonment."<sup>4</sup></p>

          <p>As the mechanisms of power, containment, and policing merge, the spaces that 
            young people inhabit become increasingly militarized. At the same time such 
            hyper-militarized spaces, extending from the street to the school, are abetted by a 
            cultural apparatus and public pedagogy that jump at every opportunity to demean 
            and demonize young people, especially poor minority youth, by representing them 
            as an ever-present threat to society. In this instance, it becomes all too easy for the 
            American public to move from the notion of young people being troubled to view­ing 
            them as trouble, as a threat to be contained. Newspapers and other popular 
            media treat their audiences to an endless stream of alarming images and dehuman­izing 
            stories about rampaging young people who allegedly occupy a domestic war 
            zone. Youth are no longer categorized as Generation X, Y, or Z. On the contrary, 
            they are now defined rhetorically in mainstream media as "Generation Kill," "Killer 
            Children," or, as one CNN special labeled them, "Killers in Our Midst."<sup>5</sup></p>

          <p>Capitalizing on shocking and sensational imagery not only swells the media's 
            bot­tom line; it also adds fuel to a youth panic that insidiously portrays young people 
            as pint-size nihilists and an ever-present threat to public order. Such negative and 
            demeaning views have had disastrous consequences for young people as their lives 
            are increasingly subjected to policies and modes of governance defined through the 
            logic of punishment, surveillance, and penal control. Moreover, under the reign of 
            an expanding punishing state, coupled with the persistent structural racism of the 
            criminal justice system, the situation for a growing number of impoverished young 
            people and youth of color is getting much worse.<sup>6</sup></p>

          <p>These are young people whose labor is unneeded, who are locked out of the 
            commodity market, and who often inhabit the impoverished and soul-crushing 
            mar­gins of society. Too often they fall prey to the dictates of a youth-crime-governing 
            complex that increasingly subjects them to harsh disciplinary controls while 
            crim­inalizing more and more aspects of their behavior. How else to explain that on any 
            given day "one in every 10 young male high school dropouts is in jail or juvenile 
            detention?"° What kind of sense does it make to pass truancy laws in which a stu­dent, 
            even when he has a school pass that allows him to be out of classes early, is 
            stopped by the police and issued a $5 70 ticket for truancy?<sup>7</sup> How can we reconcile 
            the rise of zero tolerance laws in schools with the presumption that schools should 
            be places where young people can feel safe and receive an education that prepares 
            them to be thoughtfiil, critical, and socially responsible citizens when such laws 
            impose harsh penalties for often trivial infractions, increase rates of suspension and 
            expulsion, disproportionately target African American youth, push poor young 
            people out of school and often into the criminal justice system? According to the 
            Advancement Project,</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Zero tolerance has engendered a number of problems: denial of 
            education through increased suspension and expulsion rates, referrals to inadequate 
            altemative schools, lower test scores, higher dropout rates, and racial profiling of 
            students .... Once many of these youths are in "the system," they never get back on the 
            academic track. Sometimes, schools refuse to read­mit them; and even if these students do 
            return to school, they are often labeled and target­ ed for close monitoring by school staff 
            and police. Consequently, many become demoralized, drop out, and fall deeper and deeper 
            into the juvenile or criminal justice systems. Those who do not drop out may find that 
            their discipline and juvenile or criminal records haunt them when they apply to college 
            or for a scholarship or government grant, or try to enlist in the military or find 
            employment. In some places, a criminal record may prevent them or their families from 
            residing in publicly subsidized housing. In this era of zero tolerance, the con­sequences 
            of child or adolescent behaviors may long outlive students' teenage years.<sup>8</sup></p>

          <p>Where is the collective anger over the use of disciplinary policies that share a 
            shameful and close aHinity to the legacy of segregated education, slavery, racial 
            tar­geting, the harsh and ruthless criminalization of poor white and minority youth, and 
            pedagogies of punishment, all of which push young people out of school and into 
            the criminal justice system? In this instance, schools neither educate nor provide even 
            minimal training for the workplace. Instead, they simply mimic traditional lockdown 
            institutions such as the prison and display a disdain for youth that offers no apologies 
            because politicians, school boards, administrators, and some teachers have become too 
            arrogant and ruthless to imagine any resistance. Wedded to the blood­ less values of a 
            market-driven society deeply implicated in reproducing the struc­tures of racism, 
            inequality, and exclusion, schools now inhabit a "dead zone" that banishes civic 
            pedagogy, the arts, and different critical modes of intelligibility.</p>
          <p>Schools now do everything they can to deaden the imagination by defining and 
            framing classroom experiences through a lethal mix of instrumental values, 
            cost-ben­efit analyses, test-based accountability schemes, and high-stakes testing regimes. 
            These instrumentally- and market-based values and practices drown out, if not 
            repress, those spaces and pedagogical practices that provide the conditions for 
            stu­dents to think critically, value their own voices, mobilize their curiosity, engage in 
            shared learning, and-most of all-acquire the knowledge, habits, public values, and 
            social relations necessary for the practice of empowerment necessary for fostering 
            a real democracy and taking responsibility for sustaining it. More and more, it 
            appears that as schools become more militarized and subject to the latest technolo­gies 
            of regulation, surveillance, and control, they are transformed into laboratories 
            in which the limits of new authoritarian tendencies endemic to a corporate/punishing 
            society are tamed, attenuated, and tested.<sup>9</sup></p>

          <p>Where is the moral outrage over a nation that incarcerates one in one hundred 
            adults in its local, state, and federal prisons and jails, fragmenting families, 
            desolat­ing communities, and ruining the lives of millions of children?<sup>10</sup> 
            Where are the intellectuals, parents, teachers, and social movements expressing political 
            indigna­tion over a country that has the onerous and dubious distinction of being the 
            world's leading jailer of young people? Where is the moral wrath over the racist 
            prac­tices that lead to the increasing criminalization of African American youth, 
            partic­ularly those who drop out of schools with "nearly one in four young black male 
            dropouts incarcerated or otherwise institutionalized on an average day."<sup>11</sup> 
            As one politician noted, "Dropping out of high school [has become] an apprenticeship 
            for prison."<sup>12</sup></p>

          <p>The devastation wreaked by free-market policies has been largely financed in 
            the hard currency of human suffering that such policies have imposed on children, 
            readily evident in some astounding statistics that suggest a profound moral and polit­ical 
            contradiction at the heart of one of the richest democracies in the world. The 
            notion that children should be treated as a crucial social resource and represent for 
            any healthy society important ethical and political considerations about the 
            quali­ty of public life, the allocation of social provisions, and the role of the state as a 
            guardian of public interests appears to be lost. Children, for example, make up a 
            dis­proportionate share of the poor in the United States in that "they are 26 per cent 
            of the total population, but constitute 39 per cent of the poor."<sup>13</sup> ]ust as 
            alarmingly, prior to the passage of the health care reform bill, over 8 million children 
            lacked health insurance,<sup>14</sup> and millions lacked affordable child care and decent early 
            child­hood education. One of the most damaging statistics revealing how low a priority 
            children are in America can be seen in the fact that among the industrialized 
            nations in the world, the United States ranks first in billionaires and in defense 
            expenditures and yet ranks an appalling twenty-ninth in infant mortality.<sup>15</sup> As we 
            might expect, behind these grave statistics lie a series of decisions to favor those 
            already advantaged economically at the expense of the poor and socially vulnera­ble. 
            Moreover, for the last three decades we have witnessed, especially under the 
            sec­ond Bush administration, savage cuts to education, scientific research, and social 
            services such as nutritional assistance for impoverished mothers and veterans' 
            med­ical care-all of which helped find tax breaks for the inordinately rich. Sadly, it now 
            seems reasonable to assume that under the current financial crisis non-privileged 
            youth will experience even greater economic and educational hardships, while 
            becoming even more invisible to the larger society.</p>

          <p>The toll in human suffering that results from these policies of punishment and 
            neglect becomes clear in shocking stories about poor white and minority youth who 
            literally die because they lack health insurance, often have to fend for themselves 
            in the face of life's tragedies, and increasingly are excommunicated from the sphere 
            of human concern. Too many youth are now rendered invisible and disposable in a 
            world in which short-term investments yield quick profits while long-term social 
            invesunents in young people are viewed as a drag on the economy. lt gets worse. In 
            what amounts to a national disgrace, one out every five children currently lives in 
            poverty. Morever, while 10 percent of white children live in poverty, 34 percent of 
            all black children live in poor families.<sup>16</sup> With home foreclosures still on the rise, 
            school districts across the nation have identified and enrolled almost one million 
            homeless children.<sup>17</sup> There are 1.7 million more children living in poverty today than 
            in 2000. Unfortunately, their numbers are growing at an exponential rate, as 1 in 50 
            children and teens is now living in crowded rooms in seedy welfare hotels, in 
            emer­gency shelters, or with relatives, or simply living on the streets.<sup>18</sup></p>

          <p>What is unique about these children and young people is not just the severity 
            of deprivations they experience daily, but how they have been forced to view the 
            world and redefine the nature of their own childhood between the borders of 
            hopelessness and despair. There is little sense of a brighter future lying just beyond 
            the shadows of highly policed and increasingly abandoned urban spaces. An entire 
            generation of youth will not have access to the jobs, material comforts, or social 
            secu­rities available to previous generations. These children are a new generation of youth 
            forced to grow up fast-they think, act, and talk like adults. They worry about their 
            families, which may be headed by a single parent or both parents out of work and 
            searching for a job; they wonder how their parents are going to get money to buy 
            food and what it will take to pay for a doctor. And these children are no longer 
            con­fined to so-called ghettoes. As the burgeoning landscape of poverty and despair 
            spreads across our cities, suburbs, and rural areas, these children make their 
            pres­ence felt everywhere-there are just too many to ignore or hide away in the usual­ly 
            contained and invisible spaces of disposability These young people constitute a 
            new and more unsettling scene of suffering, one that reveals not only vast 
            inequal­ities in our economic landscape but also portends a liiture that has no claim to a 
            spr­ited notion hope, characteristic of an aspiring democracy.</p>

          <p>We are treated endlessly to stories in which young people are robbed of their 
            innocence as they are forced to worry about problems that are ordinarily the 
            respon­sibility of adults. Too many children find themselves living in cars or seedy motels, 
            or even worse, living on the streets. They think about gettingjobs to help their 
            par­ents buy food, put down money for an apartment, or simply get a motel room. 
            Childhood concerns about dating, sports, and hanging out with friends are now 
            replaced with more crucial, if not time-consuming and health-draining, concerns 
            about surviving on a daily basis.</p>

          <p>These narratives just scratch the surface of a new social and economic reality, 
            as millions of children now find themselves suffering physical, psychological, and 
            developmental problems that thus far have gone unacknowledged by the Obama 
            administration, as it bails out the automotive industries, banks, and other financial 
            institutions. What kind of country have we become that we cannot protect our children 
            or offer them even the most basic requirements for survival? Where is the 
            pub­lic indignation over an administration that provides a multi-billion-dollar gift to 
            Wall Street but cannot develop a public works program to put poor white and 
            minority youth to work? I-low can the American people put up with a government 
            that is willing to subsidize and rescue the insurance giant American International 
            Group but do virtually nothing to provide assistance for the nearly half of all U.S. 
            children and 90 percent of black youth who will be on food stamps at some point
            in their childhood?</p>

          <p>Everywhere we tum, we see untold amounts of hardship and human suffering 
            among young and old alike. Millions of hard-working people have lost their jobs, 
            homes, hopes, and in some cases their sanity, while Wall Street zombies flourish 
            financially and reward their incompetence, failure, and moral indifference with 
            lavish bonuses, punctuated with renewed efforts to prevent any of the reforms that 
            would put a check on the corrupt practices that produced a global financial 
            melt­down. What does it mean to witness this type of suffering among so many children 
            and not do anything about it-our attentions quickly diverted to view the specta­cles 
            and moral indifference that characterize so much of the cut-throat world of 
            real­ity TV, zombie politics, and a consumer culture that shapes the sensibilities and inner 
            lives of adults and children alike? Obama's attraction to the cultural capital of the 
            rich, his unwillingness to take risks, his Harvard-taught propensity for seeking mid­dle 
            ground, his increasing unwillingness to fight for the people who elected him, 
            and his willingness to disconnect from his own pre-election ideals make him look 
            increasingly not just weak but like a mere puppet of corporate power, an innocent 
            who has been practically eaten alive by the rich and powerful who now treat him 
            with a sense of scom and derision only matched by their own moral vacuity and 
            arro­gance. Of course, this might Suggest that I and others initially expected too much 
            from Obama, but that is not the case. I realize that reforming the current problems 
            facing the United States does not lie in the hands of one man but resides in 
            chang­ing the deeply structured economic and social relations of power and interests that 
            inform a mode of casino capitalism that for all intents and purposes is out of 
            con­trol. At the same time, Obama must be held responsible for the decisions he has 
            made--and, for the most part, those decisions that have shaped everything from 
            financial regulation to educational reform are not on the side of working- and 
            middle-class people but on the side of the rich and powerful.</p>

          <p>At this moment in history, it is more necessary than ever to enter this debate 
            over the fate of American democracy by registering youth as a central theoretical, 
            moral, and political concern. Doing so reminds adults of their ethical and political 
            responsibility to future generations and will further legitimate what it means to 
            invest in youth as a symbol for nurturing civic imagination and collective resistance 
            in response to the suffering of others. Young people provide a powerful referent for 
            a critical discussion about the long-term consequences of casino capitalism and its 
            hyper-market-driven policies, while also gesturing toward the need for putting 
            into place those conditions that make a democratic future possible. We have been 
            punishing children for a long time in the United States. Removed from the inven­tory 
            of social concerns and the list of cherished public assets, young people have been 
            either disparaged as a symbol of danger or simply rendered invisible.</p>

          <p>Viewed as another casualty of the recession, youth are no longer included in a 
            discourse about the promise of a better future. Instead they are now considered part 
            of a disposable population whose presence threatens to recall repressed collective 
            memories of adult responsibility in the service of a social contract and democratic 
            ideals. Injustice and inequality have a long legacy in the United States, and their 
            most punishing modes and lethal effects have been largely directed against poor 
            white and minority children. The shameful condition of America's youth exposes 
            not only their unbearable victimization but also those larger social and political forces 
            that speak to the callous hardening of a society that actively produces the needless 
            suffering and death of its children. The moral nihilism of a market society, the move 
            from a welfare to a warfare state, the persistent racism of the alleged "raceless" 
            soci­ety, the collapse of education into training, the deskilling of teachers and the 
            mil­itarizing of schools, the continued violations of civil liberties, the commodilication 
            of knowledge, and the rise of a pernicious corporate state work together to numb 
            us to the suffering of others, especially children.</p>

          <p>The crisis of youth is symptomatic of the crisis of democracy, and it calls us to 
            account as much for the threat that it poses as for the challenges and possibilities 
            it invokes. One way of addressing our collapsing intellectual and moral visions 
            regarding young people is to imagine those policies, values, opportunities, and 
            social relations that both invoke adult responsibility and reinforce the ethical 
            imper­ative to provide young people, especially those marginalized by race and class, 
            with the economic, social, and educational conditions that make life livable and the 
            future sustainable. Clearly, the issue at stake here is not a one-off bailout or 
            tem­porary fix but concrete structural economic, educational, and political reforms that
            provide everyone with real social, political, and individual rights and freedoms.</p>

          <p>None of the problems facing this generation will be solved unless the institu­tions, 
            social relations, and values that legitimate and reproduce current levels of 
            inequality, power, and human suffering are dismantled, along with the formative 
            cul­ture that supports it. The very ideal of democracy has been hijacked by casino 
            cap­italism and its rampant structures of inequality and power. We catch a glimpse of 
            what this means in Peter Dreier's observation that "Today, the richest one percent 
            of Americans has 22 percent of all income and about 40 percent of all wealth. This 
            is the biggest concentration of income and wealth since 1928."<sup>19</sup> This type of 
            eco­nomic inequality is not merely incompatible with a functioning democracy, it 
            makes democracy dysfunctional and corrupt. Just as government can no longer out­ 
            source its responsibilities, the American public can no longer allow its political 
            sys­tem to be govemed by the rich and powerful. Political culture has been emptied of 
            its democratic values and is in fiee fall, as it is now largely shaped by the most 
            pow­erful, politically corrupt, socially irresponsible, and morally tainted elements 
            of the society. The widening gap between the rich and the poor has to be addressed 
            if young people are to have a viable future. And that requires pervasive structural 
            reforms that constitute a real shift in both power and politics away from a market­ 
            driven system that views too many children as disposable. We need to reimagine 
            what liberty, equality, and freedom might mean as truly democratic values and 
            practices.</p>

          <p>Any society that endorses market principles as a template for shaping all 
            aspects of social life and cares more about the accumulation of capital than it does 
            about the fate of young people is in trouble. Next to the needs of the marketplace, 
            life has become cheap, if not irrelevant. We have lived too long with governments 
            and institutions that use power to promote violent acts, conveniently hiding their 
            guilt behind a notion of state secrecy or lofty claims to democracy, while 
            selective­ly punishing those considered expendable-in prisons, collapsing public 
            schools, fos­ter care institutions, and urban slums. Under the current regime of 
            free-market casino capitalism, children lack power and agency and are increasingly viewed as 
            either commodities or simply rendered disposable. lf Barack Obama's call to address 
            the crucial problems facing young people is to be taken seriously, then the politi­cal, 
            economic, and institutional conditions that both legitimate and sustain a shame­ 
            attack on youth have to be made visible, open to challenge, and transformed. This 
            can only happen by refusing the somnambulance and social amnesia that coincide 
            with the pretense ofa post-racial politics and the all-too-easy equation of free-mar­ket 
            fundamentalism and democracy, especially given the effects such illusions have 
            on those marginalized by class and color. The road to recovery must itself with 
            new social movements willing to take risks and that embrace a vision of a democ­racy 
            that is on the side of children, particularly young children in need. It must 
            enable the conditions for youth to learn-to "grow," as John Dewey once insisted, 
            as engaged social actors more alive to their responsibilities to fixture generations than 
            contemporary adult society has proven itself willing to be for them.</p>

          <p>The shift to a society now governed through crime,<sup>1</sup> market-driven values, and 
            the politics of disposability has radically transformed the public school as a site 
            for a civic and critical education. One major effect can be seen in the increasingly 
            popular practice of organizing schools through disciplinary practices that closely 
            resemble the culture of the prisons? For instance, many public schools, 
            tradition­ally viewed as nurturing, youth-friendly spaces dedicated to protecting 
            and educat­ing children, have become one of the most punitive institutions many young 
            people now face on a daily basis. Educating for citizenship, work, and the public 
            good has been replaced with models of schooling in which students, especially poor 
            minor­ity youth, are viewed either as a threat or as perpetrators of violence. When 
            not viewed as potential criminals, they are positioned as infantilized potential 
            victims of crime (on the Internet, at school, and in other youth spheres) who must 
            endure modes of governing that are demeaning and repressive.<sup>2</sup> Jonathan Simon captures 
            this transformation of schools from a public good to a security risk in the 
            following comment:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Today, in the United States, it is crime that dominates the symbolic passageway to school
            and citizenship. And behind this surface, the pathways of knowledge and power within the
            school are increasingly being shaped by crime as the model problem, and tools of criminal
            justice as the dominant technologies. Through the introduction of police, probation 
            offi­cers, prosecurors, and a host of private security professionals into the schools, 
            new forms of expertise now openly compete with pedagogic knowledge and authority for 
            shaping routines and rituals of schools .... At its core, the implicit fallacy dominating 
            many school policy debates today consists of a gross conflation of virtually all the 
            vulnerabilities of children and youth into variations on the theme of crime. This may 
            work to raise the salience of educa­tion on the public agenda, but at the cost to students 
            of an education embedded with themes of "accountability," "zero tolerance," and "norm 
            shaping."<sup>3</sup></p>
        </blockquote>

          <p>As the logic of the market and "the crime complex"<sup>4</sup> frame a number of social actions 
            in schools, students are subjected to three particularly offensive policies, often 
            defended by school authorities and politicians under the rubric of school safety First, 
            students are increasingly subjected to zero tolerance laws that are used primarily to 
            punish, repress, and exclude them. Second, they are increasingly subjected to a "crime 
            complex" in which security staff using harsh disciplinary practices now displace the 
            normative functions teachers once provided both in and outside of the classroom.</p>

          <p>Third, more and more schools are breaking down the space between education and 
            juvenile delinquency; substituting penal pedagogies for critical leaming and 
            replac­ing a school culture that fosters a discourse of possibility with a culture 
            of fear and social control. Consequently, many youth, especially poor minorities 
            in urban school systems, are not just being suspended or expelled from school but 
            also have to bear the terrible burden of being ushered into the dark precincts of 
            juvenile detention centers, adult courts, and prisons.</p>

          <p>Once seen as an invaluable public good and laboratory for critical learning and 
            engaged citizenship, public schools are increasingly viewed as a site of crime, 
            ware­houses, or containment centers. Consequently, students are also reconceived 
            through the optic of crime as populations to be managed and controlled primarily 
            by secu­rity forces. In accordance with this perception of students as potential 
            criminals and the school as a site of disorder and delinquency, schools across 
            the country since the 1980s have implemented zero tolerance policies that involve 
            the automatic impo­sition of severe penalties for first offenses of a wide range of 
            undesirable, but often harmless, behaviors. Based on the assumption that schools 
            are rife with crime and fueled by the emergence of a number of state and federal 
            laws such as the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994, mandatory sentencing legislation, 
            and the popular "three strikes and you're out" policy many educators first invoked 
            zero tolerance rules against kids who brought firearms to schools. This was 
            exacerbated by the high-pro­ file school shootings in the mid-1990s, the tragic 
            shootings at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999, and the more recent shootings 
            at Virginia Tech.</p>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>But as the climate of fear increased, the assumption that schools were dealing 
            with a new breed of student-violent, amoral, and apathetitvbegan to take hold 
            in the public imagination. Moreover, as school safety became a top educational 
            pri­ority, zero tolerance policies were broadened and now include a range of 
            behavioral infractions that encompass everything from possessing drugs or weapons 
            to threat­ening other students-all broadly conceived. Under zero tolerance policies, 
            forms of punishment that were once applied to adults now apply to first graders. 
            Students who violate what appear to be the most minor rules-such as a dress code 
            viola­tion-are increasingly subjected to zero tolerance laws that have a disparate 
            impact on students of color while being needlessly punitive. The punitive nature 
            of the zero tolerance approach is on display in a number of cases where students 
            have had to face harsh penalties that defy human compassion and reason. An example 
            is the recent high-profile case of Zachary Christie, a 6-year-old first grader, who 
            received a 45-day suspension because he brought to school his favorite Cub Scout 
            camping utensil, which can serve as a knife, fork, and spoon. Rather than being 
            treated as a young boy who simply made a mistake, he was treated by the school 
            as a suspect who deserved to be punished. It seems that the only thing being 
            punished in this case was informed reason and critical judgment. Because of the 
            national publicity the case received, school officials modified their decision and 
            allowed the boy to return to school.</p>

          <p>Most children who confront these harsh disciplinary procedures are not so lucky 
            One typical example is the case of an 8-year-old boy in the first grade at a Miami 
            elementary school who took a table knife to his school, using it to rob a classmate 
            of $1 in lunch money School officials claimed he was facing "possible expulsion and 
            charges of armed robbery."<sup>5</sup> In another incident that took place in December 2004, 
            "Porsche, a fourth-grade student at a Philadelphia, PA, elementary school, was 
            yanked out of class, handcuffed, taken to the police station and held for eight 
            hours for bringing a pair of 8-inch scissors to school. She had been using the 
            scis­sors to work on a school project at home. School district officials acknowledged 
            that the young girl was not using the scissors as a weapon or threatening anyone with 
            them, but scissors qualified as a potential weapon under state law."<sup>6</sup> It gets worse. 
            Adopting a rigidly authoritarian zero tolerance school discipline policy, the follow­ 
            ing incident in the Chicago public school system signals both bad faith and terri­ble 
            judgment on the part of educators implementing these practices. According to 
            the report <i>Education on Lockdown,</i></p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>In February 2003, a 7-year-old boy was cuffed, shackled, and forced to lie face down for more
            than an hour while being restrained by a security officer at Parker Community Academy on
            the Southwest Side. Neither the principal nor the assistant principal came to the aid of the
            first grader, who was so traumatized by the event he was not able to retum to school.<sup>7</sup></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Traditionally, students who violated school rules and the rights of others were sent 
            to the principal's office, guidance counselor, or another teacher. Corrective discipline 
            in most cases was a matter of judgment and deliberation generally handled within 
            the school by the appropriate administrator or teacher. Under such circumstances, 
            young people could defend themselves, the context of their rule violation was 
            explored (including underlying issues, such as problems at home, that may have trig­gered 
            the behavior in the first place), and the discipline they received was suited to 
            the nature of the offense. In other words, teachers and school administrators did 
            what they were supposed to do: listen, exercise judgment and discrimination, and 
            then decide how to handle an infraction. Today, in the age of standardized testing, 
            thinking, and acting, reason and judgment have been thrown out the window just 
            as teachers are increasingly being deskilled and forced to act as semi-robotic 
            tech­nicians good for little more than teaching for the test and serving as a reminder that 
            we are arriving at a day when the school curriculum will be teacher-proof Under 
            the Obama administration, teacher unions are under attack, charter schools are 
            viewed as the vanguard of reform, and teachers are forced into the role of clerks and 
            technicians who are obliged to prepare students to take standardized tests.</p>

          <p>The script is an old one, but it is even more damaging today as pedagogy is 
            stripped not only of dissenting thought but of thought itself What does it mean 
            when Florida passes legislation claiming that only facts rather than interpretation
            can be taught in social studies classrooms? What does it say about the value of 
            pub­lic education when Arizona bans ethnic studies on the grounds that it is divisive? 
            Why isn't there public outrage over right-wing conservatives in Texas falsifying 
            information presented in school textbooks in order to assert their own ideological 
            ignorance-an ignorance that will now be taught to millions of students? The fog 
            of stupidity and abuse now engulfs both teachers and students. And the result will 
            be a generation of students deprived of the right to think critically, question 
            author­ity, and develop a sense of autonomous agency.</p>

          <p>This loss of autonomy produced by the sabotaging of critical education and the 
            rise of a culture of security now defines schools through the narrow optics of 
            mea­surement and discipline. Today, as school districts link up with law enforcement 
            agencies, young people find themselves not only being expelled or suspended in 
            record rates but also "subject to citations or arrests and referrals to juvenile or 
            crim­inal courts."<sup>8</sup> Students who break even minor rules, such as pouring 
            a glass of milk on another student or engaging in a schoolyard fight, have been 
            removed from the normal school population, handed over to armed police, arrested, 
            handcuffed, shoved into patrol cars, taken to jail, fingerprinted, and subjected 
            to the harsh dic­tates of the juvenile and criminal justice systems.</p>

          <p>How educators think about children through a vocabulary that has shifted from 
            hope to punishment is evident in the effects of zero tolerance policies, which crim­inalize 
            student behavior in ways that take an incalculable toll on their lives and their 
            future. As the former nationally syndicated journalist Ellen Goodman pointed 
            out, zero tolerance has become a code word for a "quick and dirty way of kicking 
            kids out" of school.<sup>9</sup> This becomes clear as cities such as Denver and Chicago, in 
            their eagerness to appropriate and enforce zero tolerance policies in their districts, 
            do less to create a safe environment for students than simply kick more young peo­ple 
            out of the public school system, and these are not the young people who attract 
            the dominant media but poor white, brown, and black kids who increasingly are seen 
            as disposable. For example, between 2000 and 2004, the Denver Public School 
            System experienced a 71 percent increase in the number of student referrals to law 
            enforcement, many for non-violent behaviors. The Chicago School System in 2003 
            had over 8,000 students arrested, often for trivial infractions such as pushing, tar­diness, 
            and using spitballs. As part of a human waste management system, zero tol­erance policies 
            have been responsible for suspending and expelling black students 
            in record numbers. For instance, "in 2000, Blacks were 17 percent of public school 
            enrollment nationwide and 34 percent of suspensions." And when poor black youth are not 
            being suspended under the merger of school security and law-and-order poli­cies, they are 
            increasingly at risk of falling into the school-to-prison pipeline. As the 
            Advancement Project points out, the racial disparities in school suspensions, expul­sions, 
            and arrests feed and mirror similar disparities in the juvenile and criminal jus­tice systems.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>[I]n 2002, Black youths made up 16% of the juvenile population but were 43% of juvenile 
            arrests, while White youths were 78% of the juvenile population but 55% of juvenile arrests. 
            Further, in 1999, minority youths accounted for 34% of the U.S.juvenile population but 62% 
            of the youths in juvenile facilities. Because higher rates of suspensions and expulsions are likely ­
            to lead to higher rates of juvenile incarceration, it is not surprising that Black and Latino 
            youths are disproportionately represented among young people held in juvenile prisons.<sup>10</sup></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The city of Chicago, which has a large black student population, implemented a 
            take-no-prisoners approach in its use of zero tolerance policies, and the racially 
            skewed consequences are visible in grim statistics that reveal that "every dayg on 
            aver­age, more than 266 suspensions are doled out...during the school year." Moreover, 
            the number of expulsions has "mushroomed from 32 in 1995 to 3,000 in the school 
            year 2003-2004,"<sup>11</sup> most affecting poor black youth.</p>

          <p>As the culture of fear, crime, and repression dominates American public schools, 
            the culture of schooling is reconfigured through the allocation of resources used 
            pri­marily to hire more police, security staff and technologies of control and 
            surveil­lance. In some cases, schools such as the Palm Beach County system have 
            established their own police departments. Saturating schools with police and 
            security person­nel has created a host of problems for schools, teachers, and 
            students-not to men­tion that such policies tap into financial resources otherwise 
            used for actually enhancing learning. In many cases, the police and security guards 
            assigned to schools are not properly trained to deal with students and often use 
            their authori­ty in ways that extend far beyond what is either reasonable or even 
            legal. When Mayor Giuliani in 1998 allowed control of safety to be transferred to 
            the New York City Police Department, the effect was not only a jump in the number 
            of police and school safety agents but also an intensification of abuse, harassment, 
            and arrests of students throughout the school system.</p>
          <p>One example of the war-on-terror tactics used domestically and impacting 
            schools can be seen in the use of the roving metal detector program in which the 
            police arrive at a school unannounced and submit all students to metal detector 
            scans. In Criminalizing the Classroom, Elora Mukherjee describes some of the 
            dis­ruptions caused by the program:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>As soon as it was implemented, the program began to cause chaos and lost instructional time 
            at targeted schools, each morning transforming an ordinary city school into a massive police 
            encampment with dozens of police vehicles, as many as sixty SSAs [School Security Agents] 
            and NYPD officers, and long lines of students waiting to pass through the detectors to get 
            to class.<sup>12</sup></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>As she indicates, the program does more than delay classes and instructional time: 
            it also fosters abuse and violence. The following incident at Wadleigh Secondary 
            School on November 17, 2006, provides an example of how students are abused by 
            some of the police and security guards. Mukherjee writes:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The officers did not limit their search to weapons and other illegal items. They 
            confiscated cell phones, iPods, food, school supplies, and other personal items. 
            Even students with very good reasons to carry a cell phone were given no exemption. 
            A young girl with a pacemak­er told an officer that she needed her cell phone in case 
            of a medical emergency but the phone was seized nonetheless. When a student wandered 
            out of line, officers screamed, "Get the fuck back in line!" When a school counselor 
            asked the officers to refrain from cursing, one officer retorted, "I can do and say 
            whatever I want," and continued, with her colleagues, to curse.<sup>13</sup></p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>Many students in New York City have claimed that the police are often disrespect­ful 
            and verbally abusive, stating that "police curse at them, scream at them, treat them 
            like criminals, and are on 'power trips.' . . .At Martin Luther King Jr. High School, 
            one student reported, SSAs refer to students as 'baby Rikers,' implying that they are 
            convicts-in-waiting. At Louis D. Brandeis High School, SSAs degrade students 
            with comments like, 'That girl has no ass.'"<sup>14</sup> In some cases, students with severe 
            health problems had their phones taken away and, when they protested, were either 
            arrested or assaulted. Mukherjee reports that "A school aide at Paul Robeson High 
            School witnessed a Sergeant yell at, push, and then physically assault a child who 
            would not turn over his cell phone. The Sergeant hit the child in the jaw, wrestled 
            him to the ground, handcuffed him, removed him from school premises, and con­fined 
            him at the local precinct."<sup>15</sup> There have also been cases of teachers and 
            administrators being verbally abused, assaulted, and arrested while to pro­tect 
            students from overzealous security personnel or police officers.</p>

          <p>Under such circumstances, schools begin to take on the obscene and violent 
            contours one associates with maximum security prisons: unannounced locker search­es, 
            armed police patrolling the corridors, mandatory drug testing, and the ever-pre­sent 
            phalanx of lock-down security devices such as metal detectors, X-ray machines, 
            surveillance cameras, and other technologies of fear and control. Appreciated less 
            for their capacity to be educated than for the threat they pose to adults, students are 
            now treated as if they were inmates, often humiliated, detained, searched, and in 
            some cases arrested. Randall Beger is right in suggesting that the new "security 
            cul­ture in public schools [has] turned them into 'learning prisons' where the students 
            unwittingly become 'guinea pigs' to test the latest security devices."<sup>16</sup></p>

          <p>Poor black and Latino male youth are particularly at risk in this mix of demon­ic 
            representation and punitive modes of control as they are the primary object of not 
            only racist stereotypes but also a range of disciplinary policies that criminalize 
            their behavior.<sup>17</sup> Such youth, increasingly viewed as a burden and dispensable, 
            now bear the brunt of these assaults by being expelled from schools, tried in the 
            criminal justice system as adults, and arrested and jailed at rates that far exceed those 
            of their white counterparts."<sup>18</sup> While black children make up only 15 percent of the 
            juvenile population in the United States, they account for 46 percent of those put 
            behind bars and 52 percent of those whose cases end up in adult criminal courts. 
            Shockingly, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, "[a] or detention 
            cell after a child or youth gets into trouble is the only universally guaranteed child 
            policy in America."<sup>19</sup></p>

          <p>Students being miseducated, criminalized, and arrested through a form of 
            penal pedagogy in lock-down schools that resemble prisons is a cruel reminder of 
            the degree to which mainstream politicians and the American public have turned 
            their backs on young people in general and poor minority youth in particular. As 
            schools are reconfigured around the model of the prison, crime becomes the cen­tral 
            metaphor used to define the nature of schooling, while criminalizing the behav­ior 
            of young people becomes the most valued strategy in mediating the relationship 
            between educators and students. The consequences of these policies for young 
            people suggest not only an egregious abdication of responsibility-as well as 
            rea­son, judgment, and restraint-on the part of administrators, teachers, and parents,
            but also a new role for schools as they become more prison-like, eagerly adapting 
            to their role as an adjunct of the punishing state.</p>

          <p>As schools define themselves through the lens of crime and merge with the 
            dic­tates of the penal system, they eliminate a critical and nurturing space in which to 
            educate and protect children in accordance with the ideals of a democratic society. 
            As central institutions in the youth disposability industry, public schools now serve 
            to discipline and warehouse youth, while they also put in place a circuit of policies 
            and practices to make it easier for minority youth to move from schools into the 
            juvenile justice system and eventually into prison. The combination of school 
            pun­ishments and criminal penalties has proven a lethal mix for many poor minority 
            youth and has transformed schools from spaces of youth advocacy, protection, 
            hope, and equity to military fortresses, increasingly well positioned to mete out 
            injus­tice and humiliation, transforming the once-nurturing landscapes that young 
            peo­ple are compelled to inhabit. Rather than confront the war on youth, especially the
            increasing criminalization of their behavior, schools now adopt policies that both 
            participate in and legitimize the increasing absorption of young people into the 
            juve­nile and adult criminal justice system. Although state repression aimed at children 
            is not new, what is unique about the current historical moment is that the forces of 
            domestic militarization are expanding, making it easier to put young people in 
            rather than provide them with the education, services, and care they need to face 
            the growing problems characteristic of a democracy under siege. War abroad takes 
            a toll not only in the needless loss of lives but also diverts valuable resources from
            expanding public goods, especially schools and the quality of life of the young
            people who inhabit them. As minority youth increasingly become the object of
            severe disciplinary practices in public schools, many often find themselves vulner­able 
            and powerless as they are thrown into juvenile and adult courts or, even worse, 
            into overcrowded and dangerous juvenile correctional institutions and sometimes 
            adult prisons.</p>

          and the Death of Reason, vi</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>In this insufferable climate of increased repression and unabated exploitation, 
            young people and communities of color become the new casualties in an ongoing 
            war against justice, freedom, social citizenship, and democracy. Given the switch in 
            public policy from social investment to a policy of testing, measurement, and pun­ishment 
            that President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan seem will­ing to support, it 
            is clear that schools will continue to be the object of malign neglect, 
            viewed less as a public good than a public pathology. Moreover, as government 
            pol­icy continues to push for high-stakes testing, militarizing schools, and addressing 
            educational reform through the support of charter schools, it is clear that young 
            peo­ple for whom race and class loom large have become disposable and will be the first 
            to be neglected and eventually punished. After all, these are the young people who 
            are viewed as needing more resources and services while in the end lowering test 
            scores. According to the fact that schools today are viewed as instruments of 
            pro­duction and adjuncts of the corporation, they are judged largely through that which 
            can only be quantified. Consequently, public schools and the values and principles 
            through which they organized have more in common with factories and prisons than 
            with an education that prepares people to be knowledgeable, compassionate, and 
            critically engaged citizens.</p>

          <p>How much longer can a nation ignore those youth who lack the resources and 
            opportunities that were available, in a partial and incomplete way, to previous 
            gen­erations? And what does it mean when a nation becomes frozen ethically and 
            imaginatively in providing its youth with a future of hope and opportunity? Under 
            such circumstances, it is time for parents, young people, educators, writers, labor 
            unions, and social movements to take a stand and to remind themselves that not only 
            do young people deserve more, but so does an aspiring democracy that has any sense 
            of justice, vision, and hope for the future.<sup>20</sup></p>

          <p>Zombie politics has as one of its distinctive features the violence it wages 
            against young people. For instance, on May 20, 2009, Marshawn Pitts, a 15­-year-old 
            African American boy who is also a special needs student, was walking 
            down the corridor of the Academy for Learning High School in Dolton, Illinois. 
            A police officer in the school noticed that the boy's shirt was not tucked in and 
            start­ed shouting and swearing at him. Pitts claims that he immediately started to tuck 
            in his shirt, but it was too late. Within seconds, the police officer pushed him into 
            the lockers, repeatedly punched him, and then slammed him to the ground and 
            pushed his face to the floor. The officer then applied a face-down take-down hold 
            to the child, a maneuver that has resulted in over twenty deaths nationwide and is 
            banned in eight states. Pitts said he was terrified and was having a hard time 
            breathing as a result of the forceful restraint. Because of this unprovokcd attack by 
            a police officer who is supposed to protect kids in school, the young man ended up 
            with a broken nose and a bruised jaw.</p>

          <p>In case the reader suspects I have confused the facts, the assault was caught on 
            school security cameras and ended up on YouTube.<sup>1</sup> Indeed, a 15-year-old boy with 
            an early childhood brain injury and a learning disorder, attending a school for 
            spe­cial needs children, was tackled in the school and suffered injuries by a police 
            offi­cer because of a dress code violation. Pitts was not carrying a weapon. He did not 
            threaten anyone. He was not dealing drugs. In fact, he appears to have given an 
            entirely new meaning to what constitutes a clear and present danger, warranting the 
            use of force by the police-he simply did not have his shirt tucked in, and for this 
            he was beaten by a police officer three times his size. Harmless acts of indiscretion 
            are now elevated to the status of a dangerous crime.</p>

          <p>One could argue that this case is so bizarre and outrageous that the only 
            log­ical explanation is to call into question the cop's (not the young man's) mental 
            capac­ities. How could a reasonable adult trained as a professional policeman so 
            viciously assault a young boy for no apparent or legitimate reason? But that is too 
            easy. The brutalizing behavior exhibited by this unhinged police officer would be 
            better understood as symptomatic of a set of larger forces in American society that 
            are increasingly defining kids through a youth crime complex that touches almost 
            every aspect of their lives-extending from the streets they walk on to the schools 
            and community centers in which they spend most of their time.</p>

          <p>This is not meant to suggest that school violence is not a real problem. Schools 
            have an obligation to create safe environments for all of our children, environments 
            that are welcoming rather than threatening, conducive to real learning, and 
            atten­tive to the problems students face. Administrators and teachers should connect to 
            student histories, be respectful of their experiences, encourage their voices, and 
            pro­tect their rights. At the same time, school safety must take seriously the broader 
            edu­cational goal of educating students "to participate in the complex and infinitely 
            worthwhile labor of forming citizens, men and women capable of furthering what's 
            best about us and forestalling what's worst."<sup>2</sup></p>

          <p>The tragic death of 16-year-old Chicago student Derrion Albert, captured on 
            video and widely shown on the news;<sup>3</sup> the 49 school-age children who have been 
            killed in Chicago by October 2009; the 300 wounded in 2009; and the fact that one 
            recent study states that 61 percent of all school children are exposed to varying 
            degrees of violence, speak to the culture of violence that young people face every day 
            both in and out of schools. What bears repeating is that these acts of violence took 
            place in and out of schools. School violence cannot be disconnected from the 
            larg­er violence that filters through American society, nor can it be addressed by 
            demo­nizing or beating kids, or, incredulously, militarizing their schools. Nor can it be 
            understood by simply pumping money into cash-strapped schools to promote stan­dardized 
            testing, which borders on a kind of symbolic violence. The underlying eco­nomic, social, 
            and political causes of violence are largely tied to a society in which young people, 
            especially poor minority youth, simply do not matter any longer and are considered 
            disposable. Removed from the discourse of social investment, if not the social contract 
            itself, they are destined to be unemployed, having been ware­housed in schools often 
            lacking the most basic resources, and subject to a culture of violence from which they 
            can rarely escape and almost never transform on their own.</p>

          <p>In a society ruled by the living undead, young people are increasingly the 
            vic­tims of adult abuse and are maligned as dangerous and undeserving of even mild 
            forms of social investment. Hence, it is not surprising, given how little money or 
            time is spent on them, that they are treated as a threat, and their behavior endless­ly 
            monitored, controlled, and subject to harsh disciplinary measures. Schools, espe­cially 
            for poor white and minority children, are largely viewed as either testing centers 
            where young people are simply bored into passivity or submission, or they are modeled 
            after prisons-subject to punishing, zero tolerance policies, lock­ downs, constant 
            surveillance, humiliating security measures, intimidation, and sometimes assault, by 
            security and police who are often armed and roam the cor­ridors. ln short, if you are 
            poor black, brown, or white youth, you are not consid­ered a viable student or a 
            productive citizen but a potential criminal.</p>

          <p>Schools now form partnerships with the police and private security agencies. 
            Teachers, once the heroes in this coming-of-age narrative, are now a sideshow. Most 
            are deskilled, reduced to technicians teaching for the high-stakes testing machine 
            and often forced to share their responsibilities with armed security forces. 
            Administrators now confuse management with leadership and become the pawns 
            of corporate and punishing forces they can no longer control. Instead of investing 
            in disadvantaged youth, American society now punishes them, and instead of being 
            prepared for a productive life in the larger society, too many young people are 
            pushed and shoved into a criminal justice system. They move from the schools 
            directly to the juvenile detention centers, if not adult prisons. And when money is 
            pumped into the schools, it is increasingly diverted from addressing real problems 
            such as the need for more teachers, social workers, health workers, teaching aides, 
            and safe avenues of protection for kids travelling to and from school. Instead, the 
            money is invested in metal detectors, surveillance cameras, security guards, high 
            security fences, and armed police with dogs.</p>

          <p>While all youth are now suspect, poor minority youth have become the prima­ry 
            targets of modes of social regulation, crime control, and disposability-now the 
            major prisms that define many of the public institutions and spheres that govern 
            their lives. The model of policing that governs all kinds of social behaviors and  
            inter­actions also constructs a narrow range of meaning through which young people 
            define themselves. This rhetoric and practice of policing, surveillance, and 
            punish­ment have little to do with the project of youth as the social investment of the future 
            and a great deal to do with increasing powerful modes of disciplinary regulation, 
            pacification, and control-elements comprising a "youth control complex" whose 
            prominence in American society points to a state of affairs in which the claims of 
            democracy go unheard.</p>

          <p>Students being miseducated, mistreated, criminalized, and arrested through a 
            form of penal pedagogy in locked-down schools that resemble prisons is a vicious 
            and incredibly visible index of the degree to which mainstream politicians and the 
            American public have turned their backs on young people in general and poor 
            minority youth in particular. As schools are reconfigured to resemble prisons, crime 
            becomes the central metaphor used to define the school environment, while 
            crim­inalizing the behavior of young people becomes the most valued strategy in 
            medi­ating the relationship between educators and students. The consequences of these 
            policies for young people suggest not only an egregious abdication of responsibil­ity-as 
            well as reason, judgment, and restraint-on the part of administrators, teachers, and 
            parents, but also a new role for schools as they become more prison­like and more 
            segregated as a consequence, eagerly adapting to their role as an adjunct of the 
            punishing state.</p>

          <p>One wonders how many more young people have to be brutalized in their 
            schools and killed outside of schools before the American public wakes up and takes 
            seriously not only its responsibility to young people but also its commitment to a 
            mode of politics and a future that is on the side of young people rather than a vision 
            shaped largely by the values of the corporate state and the disciplinary apparatus­es 
            of the punishing criminal justice system. What do the video of Marshawn Pitts 
            being brutalized by a police officer and the equally heartbreaking video of Derrion 
            Albert being beaten to death by his peers tell us about what kids are actually learn­ing 
            in schools? Far too often, dominant media, school administrators, politicians, 
            and others insist on the pathology of privatized and collective violence that runs 
            roughshod over kids' lives in and out of schools. In the case of the police officer who 
            brutally beat Marshawn, the comforting solution is to privatize the assault, an 
            example of an individual pathology, the work of a "bad apple." The beating of 
            Derrion by other kids similarly speaks to an alleged culture of depravity that has been 
            defined for the last three decades as black, urban, and dangerous. In both cases, the 
            systemic neoliberal economic, institutional, educational, and racist underpinnings 
            of such violence disappear into the logic of individual pathology or into the always 
            crowd-pleasing categorization of the culture of blackness as pathological. Neither 
            answer will do, at least not in an aspiring democracy. Finally, what do these acts of 
            violence against children tell us about what kids are learning through the pedagog­ical 
            force of the larger culture? What do they tell us about a society that refuses to 
            recognize that the issue is not what is wrong with children, but what is wrong with 
            American society?</p>

        <article>
          <p>For the last two decades, we have lived through an historical period in which the 
            United States surrendered its already tenuous claim to democracy. The frames 
            through which democracy apprehends the lives of others as human beings worthy 
            of respect, dignity, and human rights were sacrificed to a mode of politics and 
            cul­ture that simply became an extension of war, both at home and abroad. At home 
            the punishing state increasingly replaced the welfare state, however ill-conceived, 
            as more and more individuals and groups were treated as redundant, undeserving 
            of those safety nets and basic protections that provide the conditions for living with 
            a sense of security and dignity.<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>Under such conditions, basic social supports were replaced by an increase in the 
            production of prisons, the expansion of the criminal justice system into everyday 
            life, and the further erosion of crucial civil liberties. Shared responsibilities gave way 
            to shared fears, and the only distinction that seemed to resonate in the culture was 
            between friends and patriots, on the one hand, and dissenters and enemies on 
            other.<sup>2</sup> State violence not only became acceptable, it was normalized as the 
            govern­ment spied on its citizens, suspended the right of habeas corpus, sanctioned police 
            brutality against those who questioned state power, relied on the state secrets 
            priv­ilege to hide its crimes, and increasingly reduced those public spheres that were 
            designed to protect children to containment centers and warehouses that modeled 
            themselves after prisons.</p>

          <p>Fear both altered the landscape of democratic rights and values and dehuman­ized 
            a population increasingly willing to look the other way as large segments of the 
            population were dehumanized, incarcerated, or simply treated as disposable.<sup>3</sup> The 
            dire consequences can be seen every day as the media reports a stream of tragic 
            sto­ries about decent people losing their homes, more and more young people being 
            incarcerated, and increasing numbers of people living in their cars, on the streets, 
            or in tent cities. <i>The New York Times</i> offers up a frontpage story about young peo­ple 
            leaving their recession-ridden families in order to live on the street, often sur­viving 
            by selling their bodies for money.<sup>4</sup> Reports surface in the dominant media 
            about unspeakable horrors being inflicted on children tortured in the "death cham­bers" 
            of Iraq, Cuba, and Afghanistan.<sup>5</sup> And yet the American public barely blinks.</p>

          <p>The Bush administration further eroded a culture inspired by democratic 
            val­ues, replacing it with a culture of war. During the last decade, the language and 
            ghostly shadow of war became all-embracing, not only eroding the distinction 
            between war and peace, but putting into play a public pedagogy in which nearly 
            every aspect of the culture was shaped by militarized knowledge, values, and ideals. 
            From video games and Hollywood films aided by the Department of Defense to the 
            ongoing militarization of public and higher education, the notion of the common 
            good was subordinated to a military metaphysics, war-like values, and the dictates 
            of the national security state." War was no longer the last resort of a state intent on 
            defending its territory. It morphed into a new form of public pedagogy-a type of 
            cultural war machine-designed to shape and lead the society. War became the 
            foundation for a politics that employed military language, concepts, and policing 
            relations to address problems far beyond the familiar terrains of battle. In some cases, 
            war was so aestheticized by the dominant media that it resembled an advertisement 
            for a tourist industry The upshot is that the meaning of war was rhetorically, 
            visu­ally, and materially expanded to name, legitimate, and wage battles against social 
            problems involving drugs, poverty, and our newfound enemy, Mexican immigrants.</p>

          <p>As war became normalized as the central fimction of power and politics, it
            became a regular and normative element of American society, legitimated by a state
            of exception and emergency that became permanent rather than temporary. As the
            production of violence reached beyond traditionally defined enemies and threats,
            the state now took aim at terrorism, shifting its register of power by waging war on
            a concept, broadening its pursuits, tactics, and strategies against more than any 
            spe­cific state, army, or location. The enemy was omnipresent, all the more difficult to 
            root out and all the more convenient for expanding the tactics of surveillance, the 
            culture of fear, and the resources of violence. War was now a commonplace feature 
            of American domestic and foreign policy, as the country engaged in a battle that had 
            no definitive end and demanded the constant use of violence.</p>

          <p>It is difficult to imagine how any democracy could not be corrupted when war 
            becomes the foundation of politics. Any democracy that makes war and state 
            vio­lence the organizing principle of society cannot survive for long, at least as a 
            demo­cratic entity. The country descended into a period in which society was increasingly 
            organized through the production of both symbolic and material violence. A 
            cul­ture of cruelty emerged in the media, especially in the talk radio circuit, in 
            which a sordid nationalism and a morally bankrupt nativism merged with a hyper-militarism 
            and masculinity that scorned both reason and all those who fit into the stereotype 
            of other, which appeared to include everyone who was not white and Christian. 
            Dialogue, reason, and thoughtfulness slowly disappeared from the public realm as 
            every encounter was framed within circles of certainty, staged as a fight to the death. 
            As the civic and moral center of the country disappeared under the Bush 
            adminis­tration, the language of the marketplace provided the only referent for 
            understand­ing the obligations of citizenship and global responsibility, undetened 
            by a growing war machine and culture that produced jobs, goods, and furthered the 
            war econo­my.</p>

          <p>The war abroad entered a new phase with the release of the photos of detainees 
            being tortured at Abu Ghraib prison. War as organized violence was stripped of its 
            noble aims and delusional goal of promoting democracy and revealed state violence 
            at its most degrading and dehumanizing moment. State power had become an 
            instrument of torture, ripping into the flesh of human beings, raping women, and 
            most abominably torturing children. Democracy had become a shell that not only 
            defended the unthinkable but inflicted the most horrible mutilations on both adults 
            and children deemed to be the enemies of democracy. But the mutilations were also 
            inflicted against the body politic as politicians such as former Vice President Dick 
            Cheney defended torture while the media addressed the question of torture not as 
            a violation of democratic principles or human rights but as a strategy that may or 
            may not produce concrete information. The utilitarian arguments used to defend a 
            market-driven economy that only recognizes cost-benefit analyses had now reached 
            their logical end point as similar arguments were now used to defend torture, even 
            when it involved children. The pretense of democracy was stripped bare as it was 
            revealed over and over again that the United States had become a torture state, 
            align­ing itself with infamous dictatorships such as those in Argentina and Chile during 
            the 1970s. The United States government under the Bush administration had 
            finally arrived at a point where the metaphysics of war, organized violence, and state 
            terrorism prevented them from recognizing how much they were emulating the very 
            acts of terrorism they claimed to be fighting. The circle had now been completed 
            as the warfare state had been transformed into a torture state. Everything become 
            permissible both at home and abroad just as the legal system, along with the mar­ket 
            system, legitimated a punishing and ruthless mode of Economic Darwinism that 
            viewed morality if not democracy itself as a weakness to be either scorned or 
            ignored. Self-regulation now drove the market, and narrowly defined individual 
            interests set the parameters of what was possible. The public collapsed into the 
            pri­vate, and social responsibility was reduced to the arbitrary desires of the hermetic, 
            asocial self. Not surprisingly, the inhuman and degrading not only entered public 
            discourse and shaped the debate about war, state violence, and human rights 
            abus­es but served to legitimize such practices. Torture was normalized, and the 
            promise of an aspiring democracy was irreparably damaged.<sup>6</sup></p>

          <p>The United States under the Bush administration embarked on a war on ter­ror 
            that not only defended torture as a matter of oHicial policy but furthered the 
            con­ditions for the emergence of a culture of cruelty that profoundly altered the 
            political and moral landscape of the country. As torture became normalized under 
            the Bush administration, it not only corrupted American ideals and political culture, 
            it also passed over to the dark side in sanctioning the unimaginable and unspeakable 
            tor­ture of children. While the rise of the torture state has been a subject of intense 
            con­troversy, too little has been said by intellectuals, academics, artists, writers, 
            parents, and politicians about how state violence under the Bush administration set in 
            motion a public pedagogy and political culture that not only legitimized the system­atic 
            torture of children but did so with the complicity of a dominant media that 
            either denied such practices or simply ignored them. The focus on children here is 
            deliberate because young people provide a powerful referent for not only the 
            long­term consequences of social policies, if not the future itself, but also because 
            they offer a crucial index to measure the moral and democratic values of a nation. 
            Children are the heartbeat of politics because they speak to the best of its 
            possibil­ities and promises, and yet they have in the last few years become the 
            vanishing point of moral debate, either irrelevant because of their age, discounted 
            because they are largely viewed as commodities, or scorned because they are considered 
            a threat to adult society.</p>

          <p>I have written in <i>Youth in a Suspect Society</i> and in this book that how we edu­cate 
            our youth is connected to the collective fixture we hope for.<sup>7</sup> Actually, how we 
            educate youth became meaningless as a moral issue under the Bush administration, 
            because youth were not only devalued and considered unworthy of a decent life and 
            future (one reason they were denied adequate health care), they were also reduced 
            to the status of the inhuman and depraved and subjected to cruel acts of torture in 
            sites that were as illegal as they were barbaric. In this instance, youth became the 
            negation of not only politics but also the future itself But more is at stake here than 
            making such crimes visible. There is also the moral and political imperative of 
            rais­ing serious questions about the challenges the Obama administration must address 
            in light of this shameful period in American history, especially ifit wants to reverse 
            such policies and make a claim to restoring any vestige of American democracy. Of 
            course, when a country makes torture legal and extends the disciplinary mechanisms 
            of pain, humiliation, and suffering to children, it suggests that far too many people 
            looked away while this was happening and in doing so allowed conditions to 
            emerge that made the unspeakable act of justifying the torture of children a mat­ter 
            of state policy It is time for Americans to face up to these crimes and engage 
            in a national dialogue about the political, economic, educational, and social condi­tions 
            that allowed such a dark period to emerge in American history and to hold 
            those responsible accountable for such acts.</p>

          <p>The Obama administration is under fire for its embrace of many of Bush's poli­cies, 
            but what is most disturbing is its willingness to make war, secrecy, and the sus­pension 
            of civil liberties a central feature of its own policies. Obama, in his desire 
            to look ahead, recycles a dangerous form of historical and social amnesia and over­looks 
            the political and civic pathology he inherited. Memory at its best is unsettling 
            and sometimes even dangerous in its call for individuals to become moral and 
            political witnesses, to take risks, to embrace history not merely as a critique, but as 
            a warning about how fragile democracy is and what will likely happen when the 
            principles, ideals, and elements of the culture that sustain it are allowed to slip away, 
            overtaken by forces that embrace death rather than life, fear rather than hope, 
            insularity rather than solidarity Robert Hass, the American poet, has suggested that 
            the job of education, its political job, "is to refresh the idea of justice going dead in 
            us all the time." justice is slipping away, once again, under the Obama administra­tion, 
            but it is not just the government's job to keep it from "going dead." It is also 
            our job-as parents, citizens, individuals, and educators-not merely as a matter of 
            social obligation or moral responsibility, but as an act of politics, agency, and pos­sibility.

          <p>The counter-revolution that has gripped the United States since the late 1980's (RR) 
            has been somewhat modified with the election of Barack Obama to the pres­idency. 
            Unfortunately the dark times that befell us under the second Bush admin­istration have 
            far from disappeared, especially for young people. The assault that 
            the second Bush administration waged on practically every remnant of the public 
            good-from the Constitution to the environment to public education-appears to 
            have somewhat lessened its grip as the Cbama regime moves into its second year 
            in power. Yet the range, degree, and severity of the problems the Obama team has 
            inherited from the Bush administration seem almost too daunting to address 
            suc­cessfully: a war raging in two countries, a legacy of torture and secret prisons, a 
            dis­mantling of the regulatory apparatus, a poisonous inequality that allocates resources 
            to the rich and misery to the poor, an imperial presidency that shredded the bal­ance of 
            power, a looming ecological apocalypse, a mined reputation abroad, and a 
            financial crisis that is almost unprecedented in American history-policies and 
            con­ditions that have brought great suffering to millions of Americans and many 
            mil­lions more throughout the world. But the crisis that is most often forgotten or 
            repressed in the daily headlines of gloom is the war that is being waged at home, 
            primarily against young people, who have historically been linked to the promise 
            of a better life, one that they would both inherit and reproduce for future 
            genera­tions. In a radical free-market culture, when hope is precarious and bound to 
            com­modities and a corrupt financial system, young people are no longer at risk: they 
            are the risk Young people are no longer troubled: they are trouble.</p>

          <p>The conditions produced by the financial crisis have resulted in the foreclosure 
            of not only millions of family homes but also the future of young people, as the 
            prospects of the unborn are mortgaged off in the interests of corporate power and 
            profits. As wealth moved furiously upward into private hands for the last several 
            decades,<sup>1</sup> any talk about the future has less to do with young people than with short­ 
            term investments, quick turnovers in profits, and the dismantling of the welfare state.
            Moreover, the destruction of the welfare state, or even better the social state, has 
            gone hand-in-hand with the emergence of a prison-industrial complex and a new 
            penal state that regulates, controls, contains, and punishes those who are not 
            priv­ileged by the benefits of class, color, immigration status, and gender. How else to 
            explain a national prison population that has grown from 200,000 in 1973 to 
            slightly over 2.3 million in 2010? It gets worse. The Bureau of Justice Statistics 
            reports that at the end of 2007 "over 7.3 million people were on probation, in 
            prison, or on parole-3.2 percent of all U.S. adult residents or 1 in every 31 
            adults."<sup>2</sup></p>

          <p>As policing, containment, and imprisonment merge with the market-driven dic­tates 
            of casino capitalism, the reasons for and redress of misfortune are now placed 
            entirely in the hands of isolated individuals. As the circuitry of social control and 
            power redefines the meaning of youth, particularly those marginalized by class and 
            color, young people are subjected to a number of indiscriminate, cruel, and 
            poten­tially illegal practices by the criminal justice system. In the age of instant 
            credit and quick profits, human life is reduced to just another commodity to be bought and 
            sold, and the logic of short-term investments undercuts long-term investments in 
            public welfare, young people, and a democratic ????????. Not surprisingly, young 
            people as a symbol of long-term commitment are now viewed as a liability rather 
            than an asset. Barack Obama repeatedly insisted both before and after his election
            that the United States must live up to its obligations to future generations. While 
            Obama has only been in office for a few years, it is becoming increasingly difficult 
            to see how young people are benefitting from that promise. Obama's economic 
            poli­cies are being shaped by people who caused the crisis, thus condemning children 
            to massive levels of unemployment and a future without hope. His education 
            poli­cies are simply an extension of the discredited Bush approach to schooling, and 
            Ame Duncan, the secretary of education, appears unusually illiterate when it comes to 
            being able to pose a democratic vision for education, given his love of the market, 
            testing, and his dislike for any mode of knowledge and classroom pedagogy that can­ 
            not be measured. Duncan's policies tum the language of school reform into the 
            dis­course of punishment and extend the neoliberal, zombie-like war being waged 
            against young people. For example, as jesse Hagopian points out, the</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Race to the Top Initiative is tied to a $4.3 billion fund to make states compete for 
            desper­ately needed education money by using eligibility requirements to push for charter 
            school schools publicly handed by taxpayers, yet run privately, outside the control of 
            local school boards-and merit pay schemes where teachers are paid according to student 
            test scores.</p>
            <p>Ame's turnaround play proposes closing some 5,000 schools across the country and firing 
            entire teaching staffs at schools perceived to be failing.<sup>3</sup></p>

          <p>When Jesse Hagopian interviewed Duncan, he asked him why he is putting money 
            into charter schools when a recent Stanford study suggested that public schools on 
            the whole outperformed charter schools. Hagopian's point was that if public schools 
            are outperforming charter schools, why not invest public money in schools that are 
            accountable to public control? In response, Duncan provided what can only be 
            viewed as a nonsensical answer: "There is nothing inherently good or bad about 
            charters."</p>

          <p>Not only is this answer nonsensical, but it reveals the lack of compassion and 
            understanding necessary to curb the kind of violence being waged against young 
            people in public schools, on the streets, and in a range of other spheres. Clearly, the 
            war against young people does not begin and end with public schooling. Equally 
            important is the need to recognize that American society is still in a state of 
            per­manent war, and many young people, especially poor minorities, will continue to die 
            or be maimed in imperial struggles abroad. We are still the largest arms dealer in 
            the world, and we have a Republican Party whose only goal seems to be to block 
            every policy Obama proposes regardless of whether it is good for the country as a 
            whole. The winners in this logic are the militarists, the defense industries, the 
            bankers, the most powerfiil corporations, the ruling elite, the advocates of ideolog­ical 
            rigidity, and commanding financial institutions.</p>

          <p>Under such conditions, there is a need to analyze the forces that ushered in such 
            dark times and examine their most unlikely and often invisible victims-those 
            young people who now symbolize trouble rather than promise, and who experience 
            daily the repercussions of adult neglect, ifnot scorn, especially those youth for whom 
            race and class loom large in their lives. This is a generation of young people who 
            have been betrayed by the irresponsibility of their elders and relegated to the mar­gins 
            of society, often in ways that suggest that they are an excess, redundant, a drain 
            on the empire of consumption-a population who, in the age of rampant greed and 
            rabid individualism, appear to be largely expendable and disposable.</p>

          <p>For many young people, these are dangerous times, and there is a need to 
            develop a new language for addressing both the suffering many young people expe­rience, 
            albeit to different degrees, and the promise that an aspiring democracy 
            might offer them. We seem to live at a time when politics is divorced from a sense 
            of outrage as well as a sense of hope. In the face ofa culture awash in consumerism, 
            spectacularized hyper-violence, trash television, racist talk radio, and trivialized 
            journalism, there seems to be little concern, if not understanding, of a number of 
            forces-including an unfettered free-market ideology, a dehumanizing economic 
            system, the rise of the racially skewed punishing state, and the attack on public and 
            higher education-that have come together to pose a threat to young people and 
            that are so extreme that they can be accurately described as a "war on youth."</p>

          <p>Yet, in spite of such manufactured public indifference, it is imperative that 
            edu­cators, parents, and other concerned Americans do everything they can to make 
            vis­ible those forces responsible for the dire state of today's youth. Clearly, such an 
            intervention must arise from the belief that individual and collective resistance is 
            ?? out of awareness, critical education, discerning judgment, and an ethic of 
            mutu­ality-all of which suggests a struggle that is as educational as it is political, 
            with no line dividing one from the other. While there were good reasons to celebrate 
            ini­tially the Obama victory, what has become clear is that it never offered any 
            guar­antees that the political, economic, and social conditions that have brought us to 
            the brink of disaster would fundamentally change. Substantive and lasting change 
            must come from below: from young people, students, workers, intellectuals, artists, 
            academics, parents, workers, labor unions, social movements, and other individu­als and 
            groups willing not just to demonstrate for equality, freedom, and social jus­tice but 
            to organize in order to push hope over the tipping point, push politics in 
            a new democratic and socially just direction, and engage in a collective struggle that 
            takes power away from political and corporate elites, returning it to the people who 
            are the real source of any viable democracy.</p>

          <p>As I have pointed out in much of my work, the changing punitive conditions
            youth now face in the new millennium and the degree to which they have been put
            at risk by reactionary social policies, institutional mismanagement, and shifting cul­tural 
            attitudes has assumed the status of a low-intensity war. While youth have
            always represented an ambiguous category, they have within the last years been
            under assault in ways that are entirely new, and they now face a world that is far more
            dangerous than at any other time in recent history. And these new conditions
            demand a new set of categories and vocabulary for understanding the changing
            problems youth face within the relentless expansion of a global market society, one
            that punishes all youth by treating them largely as commodities.<sup>4</sup></p>

          <p>But if the commodification of American society represents a soft war on youth, 
            the hard war takes a different and more extreme form and subjects poor youth and 
            youth of color to the harshest elements, values, and dictates of a growing youth­ 
            crime complex, governing them through a logic of punishment, surveillance, and 
            control. In this instance, even as the corporate state is in turmoil, it is transformed 
            into a punishing state, and certain segments of the youth population become the 
            object of a new mode of zombie-like governance based on the crudest forms of dis­ciplinary 
            control. For example, a recent study, Tbe Consequences of Dropping Out of High School, 
            published by Northeastem University, states that on any given day "1.4% 
            of the nation's 16-24 year olds were institutionalized of whom nearly 93% were 
            residing in correctional facilities (jails, prisons,juvenile detention centers)."<sup>5</sup> These figures become even more alarming when analyzed through the harsh realities of 
            economic deprivation and racial disadvantage. Nearly one in every ten young male 
            high school dropouts was either in jail or juvenile detention. And for African 
            American youth, the figure jumps to one in four high school dropouts being incar­cerated. 
            There are over 6.2 million high school dropouts in the United States, and 
            they lack both decent educational opportunities, adequate job-training programs, 
            and the chance for decent employment. For instance, the jobless rate for young 
            African American males has risen to a staggering 69 percent while for whites it is 
            54 percent. What becomes clear is that the high school dropout and unemployment 
            rates are increasingly driving staggering incarceration rates for young people. As this 
            recession unfolds, young people, especially poor minorities who fail to finish high 
            school, bear the brunt of a system that leaves them uneducated and jobless, ultimate­ly 
            offering them one of the two bailouts available for populations largely considered 
            disposable-either the juvenile detention center or prison. What does it say about 
            a society that can put trillions of dollars into two useless wars, offer generous tax 
            cuts for the rich, and bail out corrupt banks and insurance industries but cannot 
            pro­vide a decent education and job training opportunities for its most disadvantaged 
            youth?</p>

          <p>Out of ethical necessity, any discourse about youth should raise serious questions 
            about the social and political responsibility of educators in addressing the plight
            of young people today. What is the purpose of higher education and its faculties in
            light of the current assault on young people, especially since it is education that pro­vides 
            the intellectual foundation and values for young people to understand, inter­rogate, and 
            transform when necessary the world in which they live? Matters of popular consciousness, 
            public sentiment, and individual and social agency are far too 
            important as part of a larger political and educational struggle not be taken serious­ly 
            by academics who advocate the long and difficult project of democratic reform. 
            Tragically, few intellectuals providing critical commentary on the current conditions 
            affecting youth offer any insights regarding how the educational force of the cul­ture 
            actually works pedagogically to reproduce dominant ideologies, values, iden­tifications, 
            and consent. How exactly is it possible to imagine a more just, more 
            equitable transformation in government and economics without a simultaneous 
            transformation in culture, consciousness, social identities, and values? Finally, it is 
            impossible to understand the current crisis of youth and democracy without situ­ating 
            such a crisis in a larger theoretical and historical context.</p>

          <p>In addressing this challenge, it is important to provide a broader analysis of what
            can be called the politics of free-market fundamentalism and disposability, exam­ining 
            it as an educational, cultural, and political discourse that has gutted the
            notion of the social state and produced a set of policies that lay the groundwork for
            a politics of greed and disposability that has had and continues to have dire 
            conse­quences for society at large, and especially for young people. As home foreclosures
            reach into the millions, as more than fifteen million workers join the ranks of the
            unemployed, as the ranks of the homeless expand beyond the wildest predictions,
            children bear the brunt of these problems. As I have mentioned in previous 
            chap­ters, the notion of the child as symbol of adult responsibility and the hopeful future
            once symbolized by the figure of the child are disappearing from American life.
            Children now worry about how they can help their parents get ajob, make a mort­gage 
            payment, and simply afford to get food for a meal.</p>

          <p>We now live in a country in which the pervasive and all-embracing reach of a
            reactionary, racist, and greed-driven politics has reached its endpoint and reveals its
            own arrogance and cruelty every day in the suffering of those individuals, children,
            and families shipwrecked by the recklessness of a society that only believes in
            short-term investments and the smell of fast profits. In response to this type of bar­baric 
            behavior and systemic misuse of power, the American public is further insult­ed by a 
            culture of cruelty that is offered up by right-wing media pundits as a form
            of cheap theater. Fortunately, power is never completely on the side of domination,
            nor is it entirely in the hands of those who view youth as an excess to be contained
            or burden to be expelled. Power is also bom ofa realistic sense of hope, one that 
            sit­uates new possibilities and dreams of the future within the realities of current
            structures of domination and oppression. Young people deserve more, and it is up
            to those who are willing to assume a measure of civic courage and social 
            responsi­bility to come together and say enough is enough, and then mobilize to force
            Obama to take seriously what it might mean to live up to the principles of both an
            aspiring democracy and, yes, the Nobel Peace Prize. But more importantly, young
            people and others need to develop social movements that create a political party that
            refuses the center-right politics of the Democratic and Republican parties. This
            would be a party that matches its ideals and rhetoric with action and policies that
            benefit working- and middle-class people and not simply the elite running the
            financial institutions; this would be a politics that provides universal health care,
            expands social protections for the disadvantaged, and democraticizes wealth and
            power in the United States so as to give real meaning to a democratic politics.</p>

          <p>Zombie politics feeds off the lawlessness caused by massive inequalities in wealth,
            income, and power. lt's time to bury the dead and let the living once again inhab­
            it the regions of government, the media, the economy, and other crucial spheres of
            power.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>Democracy in the United States is experiencing both a crisis of meaning and
            a legitimation crisis. As the promise of an aspiring democracy is sacrificed
            more and more to corporate and military interests, public spheres have largely been
            commercialized, and democratic practices have been reduced to market relations,
            stripped of their worth, and subject to the narrow logics of commodification and
            profit-making. Empowerment has little to do with providing people with the
            knowledge, skills, and power to shape the forces and institutions that bear down
            on their lives and is now largely defined under the rubric of being a sawy consumer.
            When not equated with free-market capitalism, democracy is reduced to the empty
            rituals of elections largely shaped by corporate money and indifferent to relations
            of power that make a mockery out of equality, democratic participation, and col­lective 
            deliberation.<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>The undoing of democracy as a substantive ideal is most visible in the illegal
            legalities perpetuated by the Bush/Cheney regime and reproduced under the pres­idency of 
            Barack Obama that extend from the use of military commissions, the pol­icy of indefinite 
            detention, suppressing evidence of torture, maintaining secret and illegal prisons in 
            Afghanistan, to the refusal to prosecute former high-level govern­ment officials who 
            sanctioned acts of torture and other violations of human rights.</p>

          <p>As part of the crisis of legitimation, democracy's undoing can be seen in the anti­
            democratic nature of governance that has increasingly shaped domestic and foreign
            policy in the United States, policies that have been well documented by a number
            of writers extending from Noam Chomsky to Chris Hedges. What is often missed,
            however, is how such anti-democratic forces work at home in ways that are less vis­ible 
            and-when they are visiblwseem to become easily normalized, removed from
            any criticism as they settle into that ideological fog called common sense.</p>

          <p>If the first rule of politics is to make power invisible, the second rule is to 
            deval­ue critical thought by relieving people of the necessity to think critically and hold
            power accountable-always in the name of common sense. Under the populist rubric of common 
            sense, democracy is now used to invoke rationalizations for invading other countries, 
            bailing out the rich, and sanctioning the emergence of a national
            security state that increasingly criminalizes the social relations and behaviors that
            characterize those most excluded from what might be called the consumer and
            celebrity-laden dreamworlds of a market-driven society As democracy is removed
            from relations of equalityg justice, and freedom, it undergoes a legitimation crisis as
            it is transformed from a mode of politics that subverts authoritarian tendencies to
            one that reproduces them. Used to gift wrapping the interests and values of an
            authoritarian culture, the rhetoric of democracy is now invoked to legitimate its
            opposite, a discourse of security and a culture of fear enlisted by intellectuals, 
            pun­dits, and other anti-public intellectuals as all-embracing registers for mobilizing a
            rampant nationalism, hatred of immigrants, and a bunker politics organized around an 
            "us-versus-them" mentality. When tied to the discourse of democracy, such
            practices seem beyond criticism, part of a center-right mentality that views such 
            poli­cies as natural and God-given-beyond ethical and political reproach.</p>

          <p>As the country undermines its own democratic values, violence and anti-demo­cratic 
            practices become institutionalized throughout American culture, their after­ shocks barely 
            noticed, testifying to how commonplace they have become. For instance, as one major report 
            indicated recently more "than 60 percent of children were exposed to violence within the 
            past year . . . [with] nearly half of adolescents surveyed . . . assaulted at least once 
            in the previous year [and] one-quarter had wit­nessed an act of violence."<sup>2</sup> In 
            just one week, the media reported on a 12-year-old student who was arrested for doodling 
            on her desk at school. Her teacher thought it was a criminal act and called the New York City 
            police who promptly handcuffed her and took her to the local police station.<sup>3</sup> In 
            Montgomery, Maryland, a 13-year­ old student at Roberto Clemente Middle School was taken 
            out of class by securi­ty officers after she refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance!<sup>4</sup> 
            The mainstream media provide glimpses of such assaults but rarely are they analyzed within 
            a broader political and social context that highlights the political and economic conditions
            that make them possible. For instance, such assaults say nothing about the increas­ing 
            militarization of public schools, the right-wing attempts to defund them so they
            can be privatized, the rampant inequality that approximates a form of class warfare,
            or the racism often at the heart of such practices.</p>

          <p>Such actions are now normalized within the discourse of an authoritarian pol­itics 
            fueled by both the increasing militarization of all levels of society and legiti­mated 
            further through a harsh and cruel notion of Economic Darwinism. There are no shades of 
            gray in this militarized discourse, no room for uncertainty, thoughtfulness, or dialogue, 
            since this view of engagement is modeled on notions of war, battle, winning at all costs, 
            and eliminating the enemy. How this discourse plays out in shaping public education is 
            particularly revealing. Complex understanding is ban­ished under the call for a thoughtless, 
            one-size-fits-all, zero tolerance policy in schools; intelligence is now quantified using 
            formulas that may be uselill for mea­suring the heights of trees but little else; and 
            teachers are deskilled through the wide­ spread adoption of both a governing-through-crime 
            pedagogy and an equally debilitating pedagogy of high-stakes testing.<sup>5</sup></p>

           <p>Resentment builds as social services either collapse or are stretched to the 
            limit at a time when over 15 million people are unemployed and over "91.6 million 
            people-more than 30 percent of the entire population-fell below 200 percent of 
            the federal poverty line."<sup>6</sup> Emerging out of this void and shaping a more militaristic­ 
            anti-politics are the anti-public intellectuals and their corporate sponsors, eager 
            to fill the air with populist anger by supporting right-wing groups, Sarah Palin types,
            Glenn Beck clones, and self-styled patriots who bear an eerie resemblance to the
            beliefs and violent politics of the late Timothy McVeigh, who bombed a federal
            building in Oklahoma City in 1995.<sup>7</sup></p>

          <p>This emerging conglomerate and diverse group of anti-public intellectuals,
            political pundits, and populist agitators express a deep-seated hatred for government
            (often labeled as either socialist or fascist), progressive politics, and the notion that
            everyone should have access to a quality education, decent health care, employment,
            and other public services. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that Sarah
            Palin, in addressing the recent National Tea Party convention, stated: "I will live, I
            will die for the people of America, whatever I can do to help."<sup>8</sup> Surely, these words
            leave little ambiguity for members of the John Birch Society, right-wing militia
            groups, Oath Keepers white supremacists, and other armed anti-government groups
            that appear to be growing in numbers and influence under the Obama presidency.</p>

          <p>But while these lines received much attention from the dominant media, the more
            telling comment took place when Palin offered the Tea Party audience lines she lift­ed 
            from one of the more fascistic films released by Hollywood in the last decade,
            Fight Club. Inhabiting the character of a self-styled, pathologically violent 
            maver­ick, Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt), whose misogyny is matched by his 
            will­ingness to engage in acts of militia-inspired terrorism, Palin unabashedly 
            mimics one of Tyler's now-famous wisecracks in attacking Obama's clever rhetoric 
            with the line, "How's that hope); changey stuff working out for ya?"<sup>9</sup> Going rogue 
            in this con­text suggests more than a compensatory quip for any kind of sustained 
            analysis; instead it offers a seductive populist reference to lawless violence.</p>

          <p>This somewhat confused but reckless appropriation of the discourse of glam­orized 
            violence suggests the not-so-subtle ways in which violence has become the
            framing mechanism for engaging in almost any mode of politics. Under such cir­cumstances, 
            politics shares an ignoble connection to a kind of soft terrorism, a kind
            of symbolic violence blatantly tied to the pathologies of corporate cormption, state­
            sanctioned brutality, and authoritarian modes of engagement. As violence and 
            pol­itics merge, the militarization, disciplining, and oppressive regulation of American 
            society continue, often legitimated by a popular culture in which the spectacles of 
            celebrity idiocy and violence become the only stimuli left to shock people out of their 
            boredom or offer them an outlet for their anger. But it continues in ways that seem 
            incidental rather than connected, diffused of its real meaning and abstracted from 
            the politics that informs it-hence, it slips into a kind of invisibility, wrapped in the 
            logic of common sense. Under its common sense rubric, homelessness and pover­ty are now 
            criminalized; schools are dominated by zero tolerance policies that turn 
            public schools into a low-intensity war zone; school lock-downs are the new fire 
            drills; the welfare state morphs into the warfare state, and university research is 
            increasingly funded by the military and designed for military and surveillance 
            pur­poses. In one of the more frightening examples of the militarization of American
            society, David Price has brilliantly documented how government intelligence agen­cies 
            are now placing "unidentified students with undisclosed links to intelligence
            agencies into university classrooms...and has gone further...than any previous 
            intelligence initiative since World War Two. Yet, the program spreads with little 
            pub­lic notice, media coverage, or coordinated multicampus resistance."<sup>10</sup></p>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Is it any wonder that when intellectuals in the social sciences and medical fields
            assist in the illegal torture of "enemy combatants" or embed themselves in military­
            sponsored counter-insurgency campaigns, such practices rarely get the critical
            attention they deserve? All too often, the blathering disciples of common sense tell
            us that politics is rooted in natural laws, unhampered by critical thought-a kind
            of plain folk wisdom. Such appeals to the alleged obvious suggest that thinking is
            at odds with politics, and its hidden order of politics is hateful of those public 
            spaces where speaking and acting human beings actually engage in critical dialogue, 
            exer­cise discriminating judgments, and address important social problems. Common sense 
            is in effect an anti-politics because it removes questions of agency, governance,
            and critical thought from politics itself.</p>

          <p>As part of the logic of plain speak, scapegoating rhetoric replaces the civic 
            imag­ination, and a brutalizing, calculating culture of fear, demonization, and 
            criminal­ization replaces judgment, emptying politics of all substantive meaning. In this 
            dis­course, there are no social problems, only individual failings. Poverty, inadequate
            health care, soaring public debt, the bailout of corrupt financial institutions, the
            prison binge, and the destruction of public and higher education cannot be addressed
            by the logic of common sense, because such issues point to broad, complex consid­erations 
            that demand a certain amount of understanding, literacy, and a sense of political and 
            moral responsibility-all enemies of the anti-public intellectuals who wrap themselves in 
            the populist appeal of a know-nothing common sense. The pop­ulist appeal to the so-called 
            obvious makes human beings superfluous, depoliticizes politics, and transforms human beings 
            into the living dead, unable to recognize "that politics requires judgment, artful diplomacy, 
            and judicious discrimination."<sup>11</sup></p>

          <p>Common sense occupies the antithesis of Hannah Arendt's insistence that debate
            constitutes the very essence of political life."<sup>12</sup> This is the central message of the
            zombie-like Fox News, Sean Hannity, and other right-wing Linda??.mentalists who
            live in circles of certainty and reject any real attempt at debate, persuasion, and 
            delib­eration as the essence of politics. Their populist appeal to common sense to 
            justi­fy their various views of the world rejects both enlarged ways of thinking,
            thoughtfulness, and the exercise of critical judgment. Such a discourse creates a 
            zom­bie politics in which deliberation is blocked and the ethos of democracy is stripped
            of any meaning.</p>

          <p>A zombie politics enmeshed in the production of organized violence, surveil­lance
            market-driven corruption, and control, buttressed by an appeal to commonsense, 
            blocks the path to open inquiry. War not only becomes normalized under such
            circumstances, it becomes a defining force in shaping all aspects of society, 
            includ­ing its use of science and technology. Put differently, as warlike values 
            become more prevalent in American society, science and technology are increasingly 
            being har­nessed in the interest of militarized and commercialized values and 
            applications. For example, the defense industries are developing drone aircraft that 
            can be used to deliver high-tech violence not only abroad but also at home. Unmanned 
            drones, fit­ted with surveillance cameras, will soon be used to monitor demonstrations. 
            As the technology becomes more advanced, the drones will be mounted with taser guns,
            rubber bullets, and other non-lethal weaponry in order to contain allegedly unruly
            individuals and crowds.<sup>13</sup> High-tech weapons have already been used on American
            protesters, and as the state relies more and more on military values, money, and 
            influ­ence to shape its most basic institutions, the use of organized violence against
            civilians will become more commonplace. For instance, at the 2009 G20 summit
            of world leaders, democracy took a hit as the Pittsburgh police used sonic cannons
            against protestors.<sup>14</sup> These high-tech weapons were used previously by the U.S. 
            mil­itary against Somali pirates and Iraqi insurgents and create sounds loud enough to
            damage eardrums and potentially produce fatal aneurysms. In public schools, 
            sur­veillance has become so widespread that one school in Rosemont, Pennsylvania,
            issued over 1,800 laptops to high school students and then used the webcams 
            fit­ted on the computers to spy on them. The mainstream media hardly blinked, while
            the public yawned.</p>

          <p>Common sense may be good or bad in terms of its value, but in all cases it is
            unreflective sense and as such short-cuts the types of critical inquiry fundamental
            to an engaged public and an aspiring society. But it is particularly dangerous when
            it becomes the pedagogical message of choice for much of the conservative-driven
            media. Surely, common sense is of little help in explaining the existence of brain
            research that is now being used to understand and influence how people respond
            to diverse sales and political pitches. Nor does it explain why there is not a huge pub­lic 
            outcry over the emergence of a field such as neuromarketing, designed by politi­cians 
            and corporations who are "using MRIS, EEGS, and other brain-scan and
            medical technology to craft irresistible media messages designed to shift buying
            habits, political beliefs and voting patterns."<sup>15</sup> Nor does it explain the politics or the lack of public resistance to food industries using the new media to market junk food
            to children. Zombie politics loves to depoliticize any vestige of individual agency
            and will. How else to explain a story by New York Times writer Nicholas D. Kristol 
            that legitimates the notion that political judgments are primarily the result of how
            our brains are hard wired. This is the ultimate expression of anti-politics in which
            matters of agency are now removed from any sense of responsibility, relegated to the
            brave new world of genetic determinism.</p>

          <p>Under such circmnstances, memory is lost; history is erased; knowledge becomes
            militarized, and education becomes more of a tool of domination than of empow­erment. 
            One result is not merely a collective ignorance over the meaning, nature,
            and possibilities of politics but a disdain for democracy itselfthat provides the con­dition 
            for a lethal combination of political apathy and cynicism on the one hand and
            a populist anger and an ethical hardening of the culture on the other. Symbolic and 
            real violence are now the defining features of American society. Instead of appeal­ing 
            to the principles of social justice, moral responsibility, and civic courage, the 
            anti­public intellectuals and the market-driven institutions that support them laud
            common sense. What they don't mention is that underlying such appeals is a hatred
            not merely for govemment but for democracy itself The rage will continue and the
            flirtations with violence will mount. Going rogue is now a metaphor for the death
            of democratic values and support for modes of symbolic and potentially real 
            vio­lence in which all vestiges of thought, self-reflection, and dialogue are destroyed.</p>

          <p>As I have pointed out throughout this book, while the presence of zombies
            seems to dominate the news and the American political and cultural landscape, it
            does not signal the end of democratic politics. In fact, the increasing presence of the
            hyper-dead makes the need for resistance to such a politics all the more obvious,
            especially regarding those public spheres and institutions that produce knowledge,
            ideas, desires, and values crucial to an aspiring democracy. While the struggle for
            reclaiming the government as a responsible social state capable of both placing lim­its on 
            capital and providing protections for all Americans has to be central to such
            a challenge, so does the struggle over culture as a form of public pedagogy. The likes
            of Beck, Limbaugh, and Palin matter not simply because of what they say, but
            because of the emergence and influence of anti-democratic institutions and the for­mations 
            of capital that support them.</p>

          <p>Power does not work simply through the control and influence of wealth, income, and 
            resources. It also has to legitimate itself] and for that it needs to cre­ate a pedagogical 
            culture through which it can promote its ideologies and values. 
            Vast right-wing cultural apparatuses now exist in the mainstream media, on college 
            campuses, and in the government-a kind of stealth pedagogical machine that does 
            everything it can to promote its political agenda. The current fiasco in Texas and 
            Arizona speaks to the seriousness of such a struggle as ethnic studies are banned, 
            social studies curricula are rewritten so as to erase any vestige of progressive histo­ry, 
            and freedom is sabotaged as it is abstracted from politics and reduced to the prac­tice of 
            consumerism. Mythic history now combines with a notion of freedom that 
            is as reactionary as it is depoliticizing. Zombie politics thrives on a culture of 
            blind­ing illiteracy, and for such a culture to be challenged, labor, youth, unions, and 
            other groups must unite over the need to address at the very least two pressing and 
            inter­related issues.</p>

          <p>Effective resistance to zombie politics first requires addressing the political, 
            eco­nomic, and cultural conditions of massive inequality produced by casino capitalism.
            These conditions must be challenged in every sphere in which such injustices
            appear. Such inequality is destructive of human lives and human societies, defines
            matters of life and death-whose life is valued and whose life only counts as redun­dant 
            and disposable-and determines which members of society will have access to
            vital resources and which ones won't.<sup>16</sup> This is demonstrated by the inequitable
            funding of public schools and political campaigns, the poisonous influence of cor­porate 
            lobbyists in shaping legislation that benefits corporations and the rich,
            access to quality health care based on wealth rather than need, and the massive cor­rupt 
            financial institutions that make a mockery of democracy while providing a
            beachhead for expanding inequality in every aspect of our lives.</p>
          <p>The second most pressing issue involves the educational force of political and
            popular culture. Democratic ideas cannot exist without the public spheres that
            make them possible. Culture in the form of the Internet and mass media is the most
            powerful influence now used by the hyper-dead to promote their zombie politics.</p>

          <p>These spheres must be recovered. lntellectuals, parents, unions, workers, and other 
            concerned citizens need to reclaim those places that give the voiceless a voice, 
            allow those marginalized by class and race to speak, and offer everyone the opportunity 
            to reclaim an A.merica that currently oH`ers them little hope in terms of a bet­ter and 
            more just life. This not only means using altemative media to counter the 
            hate-mongers, the conservative foundations, and right-wing radio and television, 
            but also organizing in churches, synagogues, mosques, union halls, and public 
            schools in order to collectively reclaim such institutions as democratic public spheres 
            while gaining the experience needed to challenge zombie pedagogy in all of its 
            man­ifestations throughout the culture and society.</p>

          <p>Hannah Arendt has written that there are turning points in history when "the 
            decline of the old, the birth of the new, is not necessarily an affair of continuity."
            What emerges in this liminal space between generations, according to Arendt, is a
            "kind of historical no man's land" that can only be described in terms of "no longer
            and not yet."<sup>17</sup> Today, we are living in one of these in-between times. The 
            loom­ing abyss is most obvious between the "no longer" of casino capitalism and the politics­ 
            of the hyper-dead and the "not yet," which holds the potential of a new politics
            to emerge and assert the imperatives of a democracy that values trust, compassion, 
            equality, freedom, and social justice. As Americans, we must choose now whether 
            to fall back into a pit of despair and death, ever widening to contain all but the 
            immensely rich and powerful, or to move forward as politicized individuals and 
            organized communities into a fixture rooted in and sustained by democratic prin­ciples. 
            The "not yet" of this presently unknown iilture demands of us that we con­nect thought 
            with critique and outrage to a notion of realizable hope and that we heed 
            a rallying cry for justice against a zombie politics in which democracy has been 
            reduced to a graveyard for the hyper-dead. Hopefully, the voices of reason and 
            jus­tice will recognize how serious this threat to democracy really is, and when they do, 
            they will surely understand what Gil Scott-Heron meant when he talked about win­ter in 
            America.</p>

            </ul>
            <li><b>Engage in Constructive Dialogue</b><br>
              If you encounter different viewpoints, engage in respectful dialogue to understand 
              the reasoning behind them. This doesn’t mean you need to change your stance, but it 
              can open up channels for greater understanding and tolerance in an increasingly 
              polarized world.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Active Bystander Intervention</b><br>
              <b>Speak Up When You See Injustice:</b>
              Whether it’s at a protest, in your workplace, or even on social media, calling out 
              harmful behavior can make a difference. If you witness bullying, discrimination, or 
              hate speech, stand up against it. It can be daunting, but these small actions signal 
              that intolerance won’t be tolerated.<br>
              <b>Create Safe Spaces:</b>
              Foster safe environments for others to share their experiences, especially 
              marginalized voices. Supporting and amplifying the voices of those most affected by 
              authoritarian policies or injustices strengthens collective resistance.</li>
            <li><b>Build Political Awareness</b><br>
              <b>Understand Policy Impacts:</b>
              Pay close attention to how proposed policies, laws, or executive orders affect civil 
              liberties, marginalized groups, or the environment. Share this information with your 
              community to spark important conversations about what is at stake.</p>
              <b>Participate in Local Politics:</b>
              National politics are important, but local politics can often have a more immediate 
              impact on your daily life. Attend town hall meetings, participate in school board 
              meetings, or even consider running for local office or helping others to do so. Local 
              engagement is a critical form of resistance and an essential way to influence change 
              from the ground up.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Direct Action and Civil Disobedience</b><br>
              <b>Peaceful Protests and Marches:</b>
              While direct action carries risks, it is a powerful 
              tool for social change. Participate in marches, demonstrations, or strikes to visibly 
              show your opposition to harmful policies. These events not only express dissent but 
              also help to unite people around common causes.<br>
              <b>Boycott and Divestment:</b>
              Refuse to support companies or institutions that support 
              oppressive regimes or harmful practices. Divesting from companies involved in 
              exploitation or environmental destruction is a form of resistance. Supporting 
              businesses that promote ethical values also sends a message of what you stand for.</li>
            <li><b>Volunteer and Donate</b><br>
              <b>Support Organizations Fighting for Justice:</b>
              Many grassroots organizations are 
              working tirelessly to combat systemic injustices, protect civil rights, and advocate 
              for a better future. Volunteer your time or donate to these groups to amplify their 
              efforts. This could range from civil rights organizations to climate justice movements, 
              refugee support networks, or healthcare advocacy groups.<br>
              <b>Direct Mutual Aid:</b>
              Establish or join local mutual aid networks. These networks 
              are community-led groups that work to meet the needs of individuals within their 
              communities, especially those who may be the most vulnerable. Whether it’s food, 
              housing, or support for those facing legal battles, mutual aid can counter the 
              societal fractures that authoritarianism often thrives on.</li>
            <li><b>Foster Empathy and Compassion</b><br>
              <b>Understand Oppression at Personal Levels:</b>
              Seek to understand and empathize with 
              the lived experiences of those facing discrimination or systemic oppression. This builds 
              solidarity and strengthens your resolve to stand against injustice.<br>
              <b>Intergenerational Solidarity:</b>
              Reach out to older generations who lived through 
              difficult political times. They may have valuable lessons about resilience and survival 
              during oppressive periods. Likewise, mentoring younger generations about the importance 
              of protecting democratic norms helps build a more resilient future.</li>
            <li><b>Engage in Art and Creative Resistance</b><br>
              <b>Use Art to Speak Truth:</b>
              Art, music, and literature have always played a key role 
              in resisting oppressive regimes and in holding up a mirror to society. Whether you’re 
              creating, consuming, or sharing art that challenges the status quo, you contribute to 
              the wider cultural conversation about freedom and justice.<br>
              <b>Create Public Space for Resistance:</b>
              Public art installations, murals, or 
              performances can challenge public narratives and inspire others to think critically 
              about the direction society is heading.</li>
            <li><b>Support Independent Media</b><br>
              <b>Fight Against Media Censorship:</b>
              Many authoritarian regimes target independent 
              journalism. Support media outlets that provide unbiased reporting and investigative 
              journalism. Subscribe to independent outlets, share news from non-corporate sources, 
              and participate in campaigns that defend press freedom.<br>
              <b>Create Your Own Media:</b>
              Social media, blogs, and podcasts provide platforms to 
              challenge dominant narratives. Create or amplify media that educates, raises 
              awareness, and empowers others to take action.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Nonviolent Communication</b><br>
              <b>Resist Polarization in Conversations:</b>
              In politically charged environments, 
              it’s easy for conversations to spiral into anger or division. Practice active 
              listening and nonviolent communication when engaging with those who disagree 
              with you. Find common ground where possible, and prioritize empathy over antagonism.<br>
              <b>Build Coalitions:</b>
              Recognize that resistance isn’t always about unanimous 
              agreement but about shared goals. Work with people who may not align on every issue 
              but agree on key principles, such as protecting civil liberties or opposing 
              authoritarianism.</p></li>
            <li><b>Educate the Next Generation</b><br>
              <b>Teach Civic Engagement:</b>
              If you’re a parent, teacher, or mentor, instill the 
              value of active citizenship in younger generations. Teach them about their rights, 
              the importance of voting, and how they can become engaged and informed participants 
              in society.<br>
              <b>Promote Critical Media Literacy:</b>
              Help young people recognize misinformation 
              and learn how to navigate media landscapes responsibly. In a world where disinformation 
              is increasingly common, teaching these skills is one of the most vital forms of 
              resistance.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Long-Term Resistance</b><br>
              <b>Persevere in the Face of Setbacks:</b>
              Resistance isn’t always immediate or 
              victorious. You might not see the results of your actions right away, but don’t be 
              discouraged. Change often comes incrementally, and your continued efforts contribute 
              to a larger, ongoing struggle.<br>
              <b>Strengthen Communities of Resistance:</b>
              Work to sustain resistance over the long 
              haul. This could involve creating networks of mutual support, organizing educational 
              events, or coordinating long-term campaigns that focus on sustaining democratic 
              values in the face of authoritarian pressures.</li>
            <li><b>Resist Normalizing Oppression</b><br>
              <b>Challenge Complacency:</b>
              It’s easy for society to normalize gradual encroachments 
              on freedom. Don’t let small erosions of rights become accepted as “just the way things 
              are.” Whenever there’s a new restriction or change that feels unjust or authoritarian, 
              raise awareness about its implications and demand accountability.<br>
              <b>Support Dissenters:</b>
              Be an ally to whistleblowers, activists, and journalists who 
              take risks to expose corruption or authoritarian tendencies. Standing by those who are 
              targeted for their resistance is a powerful form of solidarity.<br>
              The ultimate goal is to create a ripple effect—small, consistent actions that together 
              build a broader movement for justice, democracy, and human rights. Even in challenging 
              times, we can choose to act with resilience, courage, and hope, knowing that our 
              resistance can help shape a better future.</li>
            <li>Ich bin ein Berliner, 1963 June 26 - JF Kennedy<br>
              <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/berlin-w-germany-rudolph-wilde-platz-19630626">JF Kennedy Speech</a><br>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1ol_IG77c">JF Kennedy Berlin Speech</a></li>
            <li>Former Republican Congressman Adam Kinsinger asks a question no current Republican 
              politician appears willing to say out loud for fear that Musk, Trump, or other rightwing 
              billionaires will use the corrupt Citizens United decision to blow them out of the water 
              politically with a multimillion-dollar primary challenge:
              <blockquote>
              “[A]s I watch the behavior of our political leaders, the comments of an ever-increasingly 
              unhinged Trump, and the growing indifference of many Americans toward our role in the world, 
              I have to ask a painful question: Are we now the bad guys?”
              </blockquote>
              <p>It’s a helluva question. Our nation’s Founders overthrew a king in 1776, and paid a 
              huge price for it. Altogether, seventeen of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of 
              Independence were wiped out by the war they declared.</p>
              <p>The signers wrote in the Declaration, “we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our 
              Fortunes and our sacred Honor,” and it was a simple statement of fact. The day they 
              signed that document, each legally became a traitor and was sentenced to death for 
              treason by the ruler who controlled their lands and their homes.</p>
              <p>One of the wealthiest of the signers was Thomas Nelson of Virginia, but a year after the 
              signing the British had seized his home and lands. When he and George Washington 
              attacked the British in Nelson’s hometown, Nelson encouraged Washington to attack the 
              Nelson homestead, which British General Cornwallis had taken as his headquarters, with 
              cannons. The house was destroyed, and after the war Nelson, unable to repay loans he’d 
              taken out against it to help finance the Revolution, lost his property; he died in 
              poverty at the age of 50.</p>
              <p>The wealthy Philadelphia merchant, Robert Morris, lost 150 ships at sea in the war, 
              wiping out his small fortune; he died destitute. Signer William Ellery of Rhode Island 
              similarly lost everything, as did Virginia’s Carter Braxton and Benjamin Harrison, 
              Pennsylvania’s George Clymer, New York’s Philip Livingston, Georgia’s Lyman Hall, 
              and New Jersey’s Francis Hopkinson.</p>
              <p>The British destroyed New York’s Francis Lewis’ property and threw his wife into 
              such a hellhole of a jail that she died two years later. Three of South Carolina’s 
              four signers — Edward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., and Arthur Middleton — were 
              captured by the British and held in a filthy, unheated prison and brutally tortured 
              for a year before George Washington freed them in a prisoner exchange.</p>
              <p>New Jersey farmer John Hart’s wife died shortly after he signed the Declaration, and 
              his thirteen children were scattered among sympathetic families to hide them from 
              the British and conservative loyalists. He never saw them again, dying alone and 
              wracked with grief three years later.</p>
              <p>New Jersey State Supreme Court Justice Richard Stockton took his wife and children 
              into hiding after he signed the Declaration, but conservatives loyal to the crown 
              turned them in. He was so badly beaten and starved in the British prison that he 
              died before the war was over. His home was looted, and his wife and children 
              lived the rest of their lives as paupers.</p>
              <p>Altogether, nine of the men in that room died and four lost their children as a 
              direct result of putting their names to the Declaration of Independence. Every 
              single one had to flee his home, and, after the war, twelve returned to find only 
              rubble. They were all willing to fight and die for the idea of democracy in America. 
              Every one of them.</p>
              <p>And now, after 236 years of existence — as Donald Trump bows to Putin and tweets 
              a picture of himself cosplaying king in a gold crown — America is on the verge 
              of becoming an entirely different type of nation.</p>
              <p>We’ve always (or nearly always) been on the side of democracies. We fought against 
              fascists in World War II and defeated them. We helped create democratic alliances 
              in Europe and Asia; we led the fight to create the United Nations.</p>
              <p>And now we’re joining Russia. This century’s dictatorial, imperial power.<br>
              Monday will be the third anniversary of Putin’s brutal invasion and rape of Ukraine.<br>
              When he was a US Senator, Marco Rubio said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              “Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one. … I don’t think 
              what Vladimir Putin exhibits is leadership: I think what he exhibits is thuggery … and 
              we should be clear-eyed about that. … At the end of the day, Hillary Clinton was part 
              of the single biggest blunder ever when it came to Vladimir Putin, and that’s the reset 
              with Russia.”
              </blockquote>
              <p>Today, Lil’ Marco is talking about “incredible [investment] opportunities” 
              for American billionaires and US corporations who want to do business with Russia.
              Just five months ago, Republican Senator Lindsay Graham stood with Ukrainian President 
              Zelenskyy in Washington, DC and said, “You’re the best kind of ally. You fight the 
              Russians so we don’t have to.”<br>
              Today, Graham — like every other Republican senator and House member except Thom Tillis — 
              has been cowed into a terrified impotence, unwilling to do anything to stop or block 
              America’s new dictator-friendly democracy-hostile foreign policy.</p>
              <p>Our military is being purged along hard-right ideological lines, as was the Department 
              of Justice; the FBI is next on the firing line, although reports suggest that purge 
              began weeks ago.<br>
              Virtually every major government agency is under attack by the DOGE hackers, as the 
              America government is being crippled; Putin is no doubt delighted.<br>
              Even our defense budget is scheduled to be cut with a chainsaw, just as the threat 
              from Russia and China is at the highest point in our lifetimes.<br>
              They shut down children’s cancer research, Alzheimer’s research, and food and drugs 
              for the world’s poorest people. They are laying off FAA employees at the same time 
              planes are falling out of the sky. They’re gutting the staff that processes your 
              Social Security, tax, and Medicare payments.</p>
              <p>Trump and his MAGA crowd are tearing our government apart, apparently with 
              the goal of replacing it with something quite different than America has 
              ever experienced before.<br>
              An entirely new America. A royal America. An America of, by, and for the 
              morbidly rich.<br>
              One that resembles the vision petrobillionaire David Koch laid out in 1980 
              when he ran for Vice President on a platform calling for the destruction 
              of nearly every federal agency except the Pentagon and the end of all 
              income taxes on billionaires.<br>
              A country that will bear a little resemblance to that grand idea our Founders fought 
              and died for.<br>
              And they’re doing it as fast as they can — dismantling our country, our democracy, and 
              realigning our foreign policy — because they know once Americans catch on we will rise 
              up and try to stop them.</p>
              <p>America’s media and our free speech rights are under ideological attack, with every 
              major television network having been sued for millions; one has already capitulated. 
              A Substack newsletter writer was sued for millions by the new FBI Director. Trump even 
              sued a small Iowa newspaper and their pollster because they offended him.</p>
              <p>Both Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and Congressman Robert Garcia have been 
              threatened with investigation and imprisonment by a US attorney for their comments 
              about abortion and politics, despite the Constitution protecting members of Congress 
              from such intimidation. Schumer apologized on the floor of the Senate for saying of 
              SCOTUS justices’ anti-abortion Dobbs decision, “You have released the whirlwind and 
              you will pay the price”; Garcia is defiant.</p>
              <p>Republicans could stop this, if they will just find their spine. Every soldier in the 
              American military is willing to die for their country on a moment’s notice, every 
              single one, but elected Republicans — who are supposed to have the courage to make 
              decisions about war and peace — won’t even raise their hands or lift their voices.<br>
              History will not treat this GOP well.<br>
              <p>And to add insult to injury, this week Trump took down the agency that protects our 
              elections from foreign interference. The same sort of influence that may well have put 
              Trump into the White House in the first place.<br>
              As The New York Times noted in an article titled “Trump Dismantles Government Fight 
              Against Foreign Influence Operations”:</p>
              <blockquote>
              “Experts are alarmed that the cuts could leave the United States defenseless against 
              covert foreign influence operations and embolden foreign adversaries seeking to disrupt 
              democratic governments.”
              </blockquote>
              <p>Putin’s been playing Trump for a sucker since, apparently, 2017. That was when Trump’s 
              then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster said the president had a secret, private 
              meeting with Putin. McMaster tried to warn Trump about Putin but, he wrote in his memoir:</p>
              <blockquote>
              “Putin, a ruthless former KGB operator, played to Trump’s ego and insecurities with 
              flattery. …<br>
              “I told Trump how Putin had duped Bush and Obama. ‘Mr President, he is the best liar in 
              the world.’ I suggested that Putin was confident he could ‘play’ Trump and get what 
              he wanted, sanctions relief and the US out of Syria and Afghanistan on the cheap, by 
              manipulating Trump with ambiguous promises of a ‘better relationship’. He would offer 
              cooperation on counterterrorism, cybersecurity and arms control. “I could tell that 
              Trump was getting impatient with my ‘negative vibe’. I said what I needed to say. If 
              he was going to be contrary, I hoped he would be contrary to the Russian dictator, 
              not to me.”
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yet here we are today, with Trump realigning America toward Putin and away from the 
              democratic republic of Ukraine and the rest of democratic Europe.<br>
              As a result, Russia’s next step is to wait until Ukraine runs out of American air 
              defense systems and then just start bombing the crap out of Ukrainian cities. 
              Millions could die and it could lead to World War III, but that seems just fine with 
              Trump.<br>
              And, apparently, that’s just fine with every Republican Senator and Congress member 
              except Tillis. America is on the verge of becoming the world’s newest thug nation 
              ruled by fabulously wealthy oligarchs and a man who would be king.</p>
              <p>Thus, sadly, the answer to Congressman Kinsinger’s question is clear: Yes, we are now 
              the bad guys, at least for the moment. We are now on the side of the royal ideology of 
              absolute power held by that one man, the King, whose soldiers imprisoned, tortured, and 
              murdered so many of our nation’s Founders.<br>
              When Rhode Island’s Stephen Hopkins signed the Declaration of Independence, he 
              remarked to his friend William Ellery that,</p>
              <blockquote>
              “My hand trembles, but my heart does not.” But Virginia’s Benjamin Harrison, who 
              weighed nearly 300 pounds, commented to Massachusetts’ Elbridge Gerry, a short, thin 
              man, “With me it [the hanging] will all be over in a minute, but you will be dancing 
              on air an hour after I am gone.”
              </blockquote>
              <p>Will any Republican in today’s House or Senate — the bodies those men created — find 
              even a fraction of the courage of those who founded this nation?
              The people of America — and the world — are holding their breath, waiting for the answer.</p>

            <li><p>Henry Giroux is one of the foremost public intellectuals writing on issues of education 
            in the U.S. today. This book is another testament to his long-standing quest for a just, 
            egalitarian, and critical pedagogy against its distortion in the service of economic, 
            political and cultural power. His pungent style gives powerful voice to a passionate 
            commitment to youth whose futures are placed in jeopardy by an educational system that 
            marginalizes their intellectual, ethical, and emotional needs – and all too often becomes 
            complicit in their criminalization. The book should be required reading for anyone concerned 
            with the social consequences of the neoliberal assault on public education, which the present 
            administration regretfully has done little to roll back.</p>

            <li><p>In this timely and compelling critique of U.S. political culture, Henry Giroux makes clear 
            how it is that Americans are living through what Hannah Arendt once called ‘dark times’, 
            times in which the violence and cruelty of human disposability remains hidden in the black 
            light of an increasingly authoritarian public realm. Passionately and incisively argued, 
            Giroux’s critique offers insight into the political and pedagogical conditions that have 
            produced a ‘zombie politics’ and its associated forms of authoritarianism. In this respect, 
            Giroux illuminates what we need to see in order to reconstitute a lost social democratic 
            imagination.</p>

            <li><p>Henry Giroux offers his most passionate defense yet of democracy and civic values 
            in his new book.<br>
            This volume is a must-read in dark times like these. Giroux has for decades been an 
            outstanding tribune for democracy, an advocate for civic values and for questioning the 
            unequal status quo. In this new book, he takes up more vigorously than ever the threats to 
            the public sphere from reactionary forces gaining momentum. For Giroux, these threats to 
            humane democracy fit the ‘zombie aesthetic’ now pervading television, film, and popular 
            culture. Politics has become a monstrous caricature of public deliberation with wild 
            propositions and charges spreading fear and division. Giroux explores the hostile forces 
            sucking the blood out of our constitutional rights as well as the vitality out of ordinary 
            families. We have become a society of monopolized wealth and distributed poverty, a culture 
            of endless war, legalized torture, detention without trial, bursting prisons, and schools 
            that turn our bright children into data. These intolerable conditions require the outrage 
            and insight Giroux offers in his new book. He has written a volume inviting us to democratic 
            action and civic restoration before these dark times grow even darker.</p>

            <li><p>America was lucky. We had Washington when it mattered, we had Lincoln when it 
            mattered. And we had FDR when it mattered. But, unfortunately, a bastard named Dulles 
            ordered the killing of JFK when it mattered most. Then Nixon, Reagan (twice), Bush, 
            Bush again (Bush 2.0). Prior to that, set the stage, there was Coolidge, and Hoover. 
            Are we even a republic any longer? I would argue we are no longer a democratic-republic. 
            We are an oligarchy ran by the right-wing fucking mega-rich. Between Fox and Twitter, 
            half the population listens and far too many believe everything said.</p>

            <p>Just take a look at the Koch brothers as a example of deutsche-bags who have no 
            allegiance to anything or anyone but money & power. Fuck clean water, clean air, laws 
            or regulations. Fuck the planet. Koch fucks gave > 100 million to Heritage Foundation, 
            a right-wing organization to buy-off legislators. In return, they received billions in 
            deregulation. Tump who used his platform to make billions in meme coins. Musk who takes 
            federal money to send rockets up and send electric vehicles and trucks which look like 
            a 15-yo's wet perfect vehicle. Fuck them. They don’t need our help to get even richer. 
            Stop buying their shit with tax-dollars. Fuck them.</p>

            <p>Almost every president since Andrew ‘Coward’ Jackson has bailed out the fucking rich. 
            And killed Indians, started wars (cold and hot), killed innocent men, women, children. 
            Enslaved and jailed everyone less wealthy. And spent YOUR money to protect them. CIA 
            even murdered OUR president.</p></li>
            <li><p>Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, concluded that President Trump is a 'Putin-compromised' 
            asset. Grok cited Trump's financial ties to Russia and his consistent refusal to criticize 
            Vladimir Putin as factors in its assessment.</p>
            <p>The chatbot was developed to be 'truth-seeking,' but how seriously will anyone take 
            its conclusion?
            According to the AI chatbot called Grok, which was developed by Elon Musk’s company 
            xAI, there is a “75-85% likelihood” that the person who delivered the State of the 
            Union address on a Tuesday night (Jan, 2025) is a “Putin-compromised” Russian asset.</p>
            <p>In describing Grok, by the way, Musk said it is a “maximally truth-seeking AI, even 
            if that truth is sometimes at odds with what is politically-correct.”<br>
            Like, for example, determining that his good buddy Donald Trump, who has given Musk 
            free rein over every aspect of the federal government, is most likely a Russian 
            asset.</p>
            <p>This all began with a question put to Grok. It was:<br>
            “What is the likelihood from 1-100 that Trump is a Putin-compromised asset? Use all 
            publicly available information from 1980 on and his failure to ever say anything 
            negative about Putin but has no issue attacking allies.”</p></li>
            <li><p>The question is "Who swore their allegiances to Trump?". Target, lawyers, 
            libertarians, big oil, big plastic, coal, 12-cylinder engines, willfull liars, old 
            white men, gun-lovers, weak men, women-beaters, haters, the amoral, United Arab 
            Emerites (UAE), and lazy-brained people. The UAE "donated" 2 BILLION dollars with 
            a one-time purchase of his meme coin.</p></li>
          <li><p>5/6/2025: I am so fucking tired of hearing and seeing DOGE, Trump, and the far-right
            in the news &amp; everywhere, all at once today and every day since last November 4, 2024. 
            They (the far right) are taking all of the oxygen in the room. Nothing is left after the 
            billionaires and their idiot followers are done. They lie incessently. I don't know if 
            it's stupidity or revenge, but I didn't do it to them. So why am I suffering?</p></li>
